### Use Roslyn to generate semantic code

Scenario: I have made some utilities to generate C# code, however, I just utilize literal string
with string.format, which is not good enough after Roslyn come out. So I tried to generate semantic
code using Roslyn.

Step 1. Tried Code from [this link](http://stackoverflow.com/a/27856370/2558077),
however, there is a error:

```
Error	CS0246	The type or namespace name 'CustomWorkspace' could not be found
```

According to [this link](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/2614) modify code as follow:
```diff
- var cw = new CustomWorkspace();
+ var cw = new AdhocWorkspace();
```

Another type `Formatter` cannot be found which resolve by importing `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces`.

Credit to [this link](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/tree/master/src/Workspaces/CSharp/Portable/Formatting)

Finally the first working code look like this (with little refactoring):

```cs
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Formatting;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Syntax;
using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Formatting;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using static Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.SyntaxFactory;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var consoleWriteLine = MemberAccessExpression(SyntaxKind.SimpleMemberAccessExpression, IdentifierName("Console"), name: IdentifierName("WriteLine"));

            var arguments = ArgumentList(
                SeparatedList(
                    new[]
                    {
                        Argument(LiteralExpression(SyntaxKind.StringLiteralExpression, Literal(@"""Goodbye everyone!""", "Goodbye everyone!")))
                    }));

            var consoleWriteLineStatement = ExpressionStatement(InvocationExpression(consoleWriteLine, arguments));

            var voidType = PredefinedType(Token(SyntaxKind.VoidKeyword));

            var intType = PredefinedType(Token(SyntaxKind.IntKeyword));
            var getterBody = ReturnStatement(DefaultExpression(intType));
            var getter = AccessorDeclaration(SyntaxKind.GetAccessorDeclaration, Block(getterBody));

            var @class = ClassDeclaration("MyClass")
                .AddMembers(MethodDeclaration(voidType, "Method")
                    .WithBody(Block(consoleWriteLineStatement)))
                .AddMembers(PropertyDeclaration(intType, "Property")
                    .WithAccessorList(AccessorList(SingletonList(getter))));

            // generate code
            var cw = new AdhocWorkspace();
            cw.Options.WithChangedOption(CSharpFormattingOptions.IndentBraces, true);
            var formattedCode = Formatter.Format(@class, cw);

            Console.WriteLine(formattedCode.ToFullString());
        }
    }

}
```

It's really verbose, if I convert my generator code to something like this, the visibility and
maintainability must be dropped so much that I cannot afford. Here is a very great
[article](http://blog.comealive.io/Syntax-Factory-Vs-Parse-Text/) compared Roslyn Syntaxfactory with
ParseText. For TL;DRs, here is the conclusion:

> * When convenience and ease of maintenance is relatively most important, use ParseText
> * To be certain about the generated tree structure - use SyntaxFactory
> * To generate just one expression - SyntaxFactory for precision and correct type, and because
>   ParseText may have too little context to identify tokens and nodes in an isolated line of code.
>   SyntaxFactory.ParseExpression may also be used to parse an individual line of code.
> * To interpret arbitrary C# file - use ParseText
> * To interpret arbitrary string and build just one expression - use SyntaxFactory.ParseExpression or
>   use ParseText with CSharpParseOptions.WithKind(SourceCodeKind.Script).

For my case, I choose to use ParseText.

### Prefix spaces for each line in a string

My code generator requires to generate code with right indentation, so I need to prefix spaces for
each line of a string. After google the world, there isn't a out-of-box solution for me to use,
finally I came up with my own solution:

```cs
internal static string Indent(this string content, int level = 1) => string.Join(Environment.NewLine, content
    .Split(new[] { "\r\n" }, StringSplitOptions.None)
    .Select(_ => $"{(_ == string.Empty ? string.Empty : new string(' ', level * 4))}{_}")
    .ToArray());
```

Usage like this:

```cs
var result = str.Indent();
```

### Ternary(?:) condition returning method(delegate) not compile.

I'm facing the same situation like [this link](http://stackoverflow.com/q/6015747/2558077).

Here is the reproductive code with solution:

```cs
private static void Test()
{
    var c = true;

    // The following line provokes a compiler error:
    // "Type of conditional expression cannot be determined because there is 
    // no implicit conversion between 'method group' and 'method group".
    //var d = c ? a : b;

    // Instead, following code work as expected.
    var d = c ? (Func<bool>)a : b;
}

private static bool a()
{
    return true;
}

private static bool b()
{
    return false;
}
```

However, before I got this simple solution, I worked on another solution and find out it gain better
visibility and maintainability.

Take a look:

```cs
var genDict = new Dictionary<ClassTypeEnum, Func<string, string, string>>
{
    [ClassTypeEnum.FirstLevel] = GenFirstLevelClass,
    [ClassTypeEnum.Array] = GenArrayClass,
    [ClassTypeEnum.Standard] = GenStandardClass,
};
var genType = isFirstLevelClass ? ClassTypeEnum.FirstLevel : (isArrayClass ? ClassTypeEnum.Array : ClassTypeEnum.Standard);
output += genDict[genType](classname, content).Indent();
```

The signature of `GenFirstLevelClass`, `GenArrayClass` and `GenStandardClass` are like following:

```cs
private static string GenStandardClass(string classname, string content)
```

Here is the version which workaround this issue.

```cs
var gen = isFirstLevelClass ? GenFirstLevelClass : (isArrayClass ? GenArrayClass : (Func<string, string, string>)GenStandardClass);
output += gen(classname, content).Indent();
```

How do you think?

### Send keystroke to application

The goal I want to achieve is send keystroke to another application, which is the core function of my
new open source application [TouchAssistant](https://github.com/wizicer/TouchAssistant). And I want
the keystroke can be customized easily by configuration from user interaction.

1. Use WinAPI `keybd_event` as this [Link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8339565) suggested.
   example as followed:

  ```cs
  [DllImport("user32.dll")]
  static extern uint keybd_event(byte bVk, byte bScan, int dwFlags, int dwExtraInfo);
  ```

  So far, I'm using this API, no shortcoming except no one liner to simulate keystroke with
  modifier.

2. Use WinAPI `SendInput` as this [Link](http://www.pinvoke.net/default.aspx/user32.sendinput)
   suggested. **Note** this API is available after Vista.

  ```cs
  [DllImport("user32.dll")]
  static extern uint SendInput (uint nInputs, [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.LPArray), In] INPUT[] pInputs,Â int cbSize);
  ```

  Much complex than previous one, however, it may get better compatibility especially with future
  version of Windows.

3. Original WinForm has a method like following:

  ```cs
  System.Windows.Forms.SendKeys.SendWait("{ESC}");
  ```

  Very powerful function, and can be configured to use `keybd_event` or `SendInput` internally.
  However, it's not so good to reference `System.Windows.Forms` in WPF application.

4. There is an open source project [Windows Input Simulator](http://inputsimulator.codeplex.com/). 
  
  Good wrapper, however, cannot gain enough flexibility for user customization like AHK or SendKeys
  did.

5. Integrate AHK by using <https://github.com/amazing-andrew/AutoHotkey.Interop>

### Event during DragMove?

In my application [TouchAssistant](https://github.com/wizicer/TouchAssistant) I want it *disappear*
after few seconds if no user interaction, however, after called `DragMove()`, there is no chance for me to
listen to extra events to know if user still interacted with the program.

There is a very good explanation about it from this [Link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3592488).

> DragMove starts a modal message loop and doesn't return until the mouse button is released, so by
> the time the button receives the MouseLeftButtonDown event it's already lost the chance to click.

The solution is simple, just set a variable before executing `DragMove`, and unset the variable
after the execution. Your program can depend on this variable.

### Unit test hangs when testing WPF program with `Dispatcher`

The unit test hangs at following statement which is working well in real life WPF program.

```cs
Application.Current.Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Background, new Action(() => { }));
```

Following phenomenons may draw your attention that caused this issue:

* Unit test sometime passed, sometime hangs(seems always running in Test Explorer).
* Unit test in Resharper reported `aborted` with a hand icon.
* Only after I start unit test with `nunit-console.exe`, and attached to it to debug with Visual
  Studio, I found which statement hangs.

To workaround this issue, following implementation may help.
Credit to [this Link](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24363344/2558077)

```cs
public static class DispatcherUtil
{
    [SecurityPermission(SecurityAction.Demand, Flags = SecurityPermissionFlag.UnmanagedCode)]
    public static void DoEvents()
    {
        var frame = new DispatcherFrame();
        Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher.BeginInvoke(DispatcherPriority.Background,
            new DispatcherOperationCallback(ExitFrame), frame);
        Dispatcher.PushFrame(frame);
    }

    public static void DoEventsSync()
    {
        var frame = new DispatcherFrame();
        Dispatcher.CurrentDispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Background,
            new DispatcherOperationCallback(ExitFrame), frame);
        Dispatcher.PushFrame(frame);
    }

    private static object ExitFrame(object frame)
    {
        ((DispatcherFrame)frame).Continue = false;
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Compile Error: Create a delegate when there is a conditional attribute

Solution: Wrapping in lambda function.

[Link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20638873/create-a-delegate-when-there-is-a-conditional-attribute)

### `<Service Include="{B4F97281-0DBD-4835-9ED8-7DFB966E87FF}" />` in csproj file

As described in this [answer](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/800245/vs2013rc-adds-to-vs2012-c-project-section-itemgroup) from Microsoft:

> This behavior is intentional.
>
> To support third-party test frameworks, like NUnit and XUnit, Visual Studio 2012 loaded Test
> Explorer on solution open, regardless of whether it contained test projects. This added seconds of
> delay to startup and solution open scenarios for all users, majority of whom don't use tests.
>
> In Visual Studio 2013, we changed it so that Test Explorer package is loaded only when the solution
> contains one or more test projects. Test projects are identified in two different ways. Projects
> created from one of the built-in unit test project templates are identified using project type
> GUIDs. Other types of projects, such as Class Library project with XUnit or NUnit tests, are
> identified by Test Explorer during first test discovery and "tagged" with the \<Service/\> item.

To workaround this issue: 

> Personally I don't like this service added to my project files and I think having it is more like a
> workaround rather than a proper solution. So marking your test projects as test projects seems more
> correct to me and this can be achieved by adding this to the first PropertyGroup:

```xml
<ProjectTypeGuids>{3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}</ProjectTypeGuids>
<TestProjectType>UnitTest</TestProjectType>
```

> {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB} means Test Project and {FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}

### Error Message: Cannot modify the return value of 'expression' because it is not a variable

Example code which raises the error:
```cs
public Point Origin { get; set; }

Origin.X = 10; // fails with CS1612
```

As a matter of fact, the misuse itself is obviously to who familiar with the character of `struct`
-- `immutable`. However, the message itself is really confusing.

PS: workaround code

```cs
Origin = new Point(10, Origin.Y);
```

### Merge a individual application configure file (AppSettings) to application

**Scenario Description**: for some reason we don't want to modify the main configure file which name
is `xxx.exe.config`, so we store configures in another file `ConfigurationFile`.

**Failure Trial**

Intuitively, I write following code try to open the extra configure file.

```cs
var c = ConfigurationManager.OpenExeConfiguration(path);
```

Whatever path you use until you have `xxx.exe` and `xxx.exe.config` in pair, you will get following
error:

```
Exception thrown: 'System.Configuration.ConfigurationErrorsException' in System.Configuration.dll

Additional information: An error occurred loading a configuration file: The parameter 'exePath' is invalid.
```

**Success Trial**

The key is we have a configure file without its executable exist, how we workaround this issue is
`new ExeConfigurationFileMap { ExeConfigFilename = Path.Combine(loc, ConfigurationFile) };`

The complete code of merge as followed:

```cs
private static void MergeAppSettings()
{
    var loc = Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location);
    var map = new ExeConfigurationFileMap { ExeConfigFilename = Path.Combine(loc, ConfigurationFile) };
    var cfg = ConfigurationManager.OpenMappedExeConfiguration(map, ConfigurationUserLevel.None);
    foreach (KeyValueConfigurationElement item in cfg.AppSettings.Settings)
    {
        if (ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[item.Key] == null)
        {
            ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[item.Key] = item.Value;
        }
    }
}
```

### #if DEBUG vs. Conditional("DEBUG")

Extract key information from [this great explanation](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3788719/2558077)

* `#if DEBUG`: The code in here won't even reach the IL on release.
* `[Conditional("DEBUG")]`: This code will reach the IL, however calls to the method will be omitted
  unless DEBUG is set when the caller is **compiled**.

**Common Best Practice**

* Use `#if DEBUG` for different variable assignment.
* Use `[Conditional("DEBUG")]` for method invocation.

### `Task.Run` with STA apartment state

Use following code instead of `Task.Run`, [Source](https://github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/103#issuecomment-62822506)

```cs
public static Task<T> StartSTATask<T>(Func<T> func)
{
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<T>();
    var thread = new Thread(() =>
    {
        try
        {
            var result = func();
            tcs.SetResult(result);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            tcs.SetException(e);
        }
    });
    thread.SetApartmentState(ApartmentState.STA);
    thread.Start();
    return tcs.Task;
}
```

### Dependency check(restriction) of csproj

1. still cannot achieved by using code analysis
2. use `.Net Architecture Checker`

### `AssemblyVersion` vs `FileVersion` vs `ProductVersion`

* `AssemblyVersion` is used for assembly reference.
* `FileVersion` is used for mark which build the assembly produced.
* `ProductVersion` is used for marketing, not used in program. **Note**: aka
  `AssemblyInformationalVersion`

eg, version of `mscorlib 2.0.0.0`

* `AssemblyVersion`: 2.0.0.0
* `FileVersion`: 2.0.50727.3521
* `ProductVersion`: 2.0.50727.3521

### Error raised by xaml: `does not have a resource identifier by the uri`

Scenario is when try to load two different version of assemblies.(same code with different Assembly
Version) 

It's limitation to Xaml generator. Workaround:
1. put `<AssemblyVersion>` in `.csproj` file.
2. use build parameter.

### Error `xceed.wpf.toolkit.aerolite` in xaml when use xceed

Ignore it, as it's internal mechanism to try to load it.

### `LoadFile` vs `LoadFrom` in `Assembly`

* `LoadFrom`, default action when .Net load assembly, load only once for same identity even in two
  location with different meta data.
* `LoadFile`, load exactly what was requested, and would not load dependency.

### Dynamic Module(Assembly)?

Use `AssemblyBuilder`

### `Task.Run` is not available and error `doesn't contain a definition for 'GetAwaiter'` in `Task.Factory.StartNew` 

`Task.Run` is available since .Net 4.5 and this error would disappear after switched target to 4.5

### async WPF click event for CPU intensive operation

Lesson learned:

1. Don't use async/await in .Net 4.0.
2. Use `Task.Run` to replace the CPU intensive code.
3. Need to manually fire `PropertyChanged` event for ViewModel.

### async linq?

In a word, linq was not designed to be asynced.

### Side effects of `[Serializable]`

No, because it's `Attribute` which only read by some program runtime.

### Caliburn.Micro `PropertyChangedBase` not Serializable. (Even mark as Serializable who inherit it)

It marks with `[DataContract]`, maybe mark field with `[DataMember]` can fix this(not test).

### Cannot be Serializable who implement INotifyPropertyChanged

Because the event, change it to:

```cs
[field:NonSerializable]
public event ChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
```

### Performance: AppDomain vs Process

No comparison found, however, obviously AppDomain should be much faster than process which not
involving a lot of system resource allocation.
