Some things you can add by clicking on the prefab and adding items using the Component menu. For
more involved changes, drag the prefab into the scene, make whatever changes are necessary (ignore
the message about breaking the prefab link), and when done, select Apply Changes to Prefab from the
GameObject menu. Then delete the prefab from the scene.
