### About Me

I am **Shuang Liang** (**梁爽**), nick name is  **Wizard Glacier**, English name abbreviated as **Icer**, currently delving into various possibilities of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**.
First exposed to computers in 1994, started programming in 1999, led a team as an architect in 2008, which laid the foundation for my future goal of becoming an architect.
Although I have a wide range of computer technology knowledge, I have been labeled as a Microsoft supporter due to my deep familiarity with QB, VB, C#, TypeScript.
I am currently focusing on writing in Rust.

In my undergraduate lab, I mainly researched pattern recognition technology.
During my employment at <abbr title="Beijing DMedia Technology Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of China Mobile) Chongqing Branch">Fetion</abbr>, I developed a high-performance, high-reliability, and high-flexibility server program.
During my employment at <abbr title="Honeywell Integrated Technology (China) Co., Ltd.">Honeywell</abbr>, I accumulated the ability to manage software engineering and agile teams that adapt to rapidly changing business needs.
During my <abbr title="Shanghai Sutu Technology">startup</abbr> period, I attempted to develop all key components of Web3, gaining in-depth development experience from the underlying full nodes, consensus, virtual machines of the blockchain to the upper-level browsers, wallets, etc.
During my <abbr title="PhD Candidate, Shanghai Jiaotong University, CS">PhD</abbr> period, I mainly researched the combination of zero-knowledge proof technology and database management system theory, but due to the burden of laboratory affairs, I am currently on a leave of absence.

My experience is unique, possessing basic scientific research capabilities, but focusing on the engineering field, committed to leading engineers to turn theoretical papers into reliable products that bring happiness to people.
I have the engineering ability to turn any idea into reality at a controlled cost, and also have the scientific research ability to verify the reliability and completeness of engineering implementation, which will make me an architect who can lead the times.
