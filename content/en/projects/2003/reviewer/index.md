**Introduction**: Glacier Comments is a comment editing system specially developed for teachers, whenever the end of the semester comes, it is always the teacher who is the most tired, and the most troublesome of them is to write comments, if with the help of modern tools, then this will definitely make you get a qualitative leap in efficiency.

**Tech Essentials**: Printing, fully used API. Cool interface, implemented by self-developed classes. Input prompt for the input area, IDE-like interface implemented in code. Database encryption and decryption, although not expressed, but embodies a kind of idea of protecting data security.

**Self-evaluation**: This is what I started to make when I learned VB in the second year of junior high school, from a software with only basic functions, after upgrading to the first year of high school, it has become very professional, which is the most painstaking and time-consuming of all my software, and it is also the most technical, and it is my favorite thing to put down. It's a blend of three of my favorite exotic cryptography techniques, with no particular purpose, and it's all about practical technology.

**Honors**: This software is always among the best in its kind of software in major download sites. A teacher once sent a letter thanking him, "You are really a good example of Chinese gardeners, thank you for your software". Won the first prize in Chongqing in the "Computer Works Competition for Chinese Primary and Middle School Students". In just one year of high school, more than 300 registered users were obtained.
