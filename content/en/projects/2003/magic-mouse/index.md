**Introduction**: Recently playing "Black and White", I think it is really very good, the magic part of it makes me feel curious, it is completely a mouse trajectory recognition system, if it can be done under Windows it must be very dizzy! I've already made it, now you're trying it too? 

**Self-evaluation**: This is the work of the winter vacation of the first year of high school, when I happened to be playing the game "Black and White", and I was interested in the magic system in it, so I briefly studied it and made this little software by the way.

**Scope of application outlook**: Sometimes I think this is actually very boring, the speed of operation is not as good as opening shortcuts, but please note that if you want to show someone something, you don't want others to know where you put it, which comes in handy, and this can be used as a tool for entering passwords, a special password, so the development prospects are very broad!
