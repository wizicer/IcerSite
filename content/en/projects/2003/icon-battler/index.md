Icon Wars, 2003, VB6, the first Internet-enabled battle game, used image processing algorithms to calculate the health/attack/defense of icons for the first time

**Introduction**: Drag two files here to fight their icons and enjoy this classic battle, this software also supports online battles, compare your selected icon warriors with your companions.

**Self-evaluation**: This is a small software I made in my first year of high school, which is used for technical practice, mainly for the online battle part. It uses a lot of APIs, but this is also a classic game, unfortunately not my creativity, but this is also another game of mine.
