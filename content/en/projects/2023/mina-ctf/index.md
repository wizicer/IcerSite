Playing CTF games is a great way to practice your programming skills.

CTF (Capture The Flag) is a type of competition in which teams or individuals need to solve a series of challenges. The one who solves/collects the most flags and has the fastest speed wins the game. Once each challenge is successfully solved, the user will find a "flag" in the challenge, which is proof of completion.
