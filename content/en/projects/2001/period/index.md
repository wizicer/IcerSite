**Introduction**: According to the cycle theory, the human biological cycle curve is intuitively displayed, and through internal and external adjustment, the candidate's intelligence, emotions and physical strength during the examination can be optimal. This software is green software, easy to carry around, can be queried instantly, and the character list can easily let you see the situation of a group.

**Technical Essentials**: The program has a "super match" function that calculates the degree of matching between two people, as well as the date when they are the best match, all using an optimized algorithm.

**Self-evaluation**: This was made when I was in the second year of junior high school, when I happened to learn functions, I suddenly thought of the biological cycle, so I looked through a lot of information, confirmed their respective cycles, and tried to compile this software, and then, every time before the exam, I took it out to check, and it felt very practical. Of course, the multi-user feature allows me to check for my classmates.
