**Introduction**: My website has been revised again, looking at the complex and good-looking bamboo leaf source map I designed, I really don't know what to do! I checked it on the Internet, and there was no software in this regard, and under the scoundrel, I only compiled one myself. I think it works! The so-called sharpening knife does not cut wood by mistake, I designed the program and finished the bamboo leaves, which is 10 times faster than before, and I am not afraid of a little change in the future! He helped me cut the picture into pieces so I could put them on my website.

**Self-evaluation**: This is the product of the second issue of my homepage in the second issue of junior high school, when I accepted the first lesson, decided to find a convenient way, searched the Internet, and finally found nothing, I suddenly became interested in programming and decided to make one, this software was born, and later it was widely praised by netizens, and also put forward a lot of suggestions for improvement, it seems that this software is very popular. Of course, Macromedia Fireworks came out and included this feature, so my software was out of history.
