In 2002, my first graphical game, VB6

**Introduction**: Players can design their own plot according to their own ideas, through the map editor can design a rich variety of maps, by writing scripts, designing characters, and dialogue, a game full of personality is born.

**Self-evaluation**: This was designed and produced for a week during the summer vacation after graduating from junior high school, and I felt that the best thing to do was the map editor, which has all the functions that a map editor should have, and has been optimized in operation, making it easier to use. The main program was originally designed with a combat system, but since there was no time to debug after the start of school, there was no combat part in the final version. It was kind of the beginning of my gamemaking.

**Review**: This work is also an adjunct to my e-magazine Game Ideas and Production, which was a boom in the amateur game industry, but many working groups died in the process, and in order not to have the same fate for my games, I strongly promoted the use of e-magazines as a strong backing for game production, not only to make the technology transparent, but also to get more talent to join.
