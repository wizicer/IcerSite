**Note**: The clock has become very popular, but to see the time of many regions in a clock, it seems to be less common, this clock is born from this, the dial is printed with the name of each region, you can see the time of each country at a glance, the red region name is the opposite of the blue area day and night, so the time in any corner of the world can be represented by this dial, and the cost of this clock is very low, you can DIY one.

**Creative source**: I remember once going out on a trip and seeing a row of clocks hanging in the hotel, I asked my mother strangely, why are there so many clocks, when I knew that this was to facilitate foreign tourists to see the time, I naively said that it was much more convenient to overlap those hour hands, saving a lot of space. But time quickly erased these, until the fourth grade began to study society, the concept of time zones appeared in the textbooks, I felt that I had the ability to make this little clock real idea, so after a few hours of hard fighting, this world clock was made, which is what everyone sees now.

Postscript: After many years, until the first year of high school, I heard that a comrade applied for a patent for such a clock, I don't know if this is necessary, I think there may already be many people who make this kind of thing, right?

**About my invention**: When I was bored as a child, I was very good at crafts, so I did a lot of interesting little things, such as learning to make an alarm system in a science fiction movie (I thought it was true at the time), of course, the final result was that I called inexplicably in the middle of the night, and in order to escape the detection of my parents, I made a folder with lights, you can read comfortably in the quilt, and more interestingly, I learned to make a jet wooden car in the cartoon, and the power also used the balloon drawn in the cartoon, Of course, the end result is: being able to exercise a centimeter, and so on, can be seen everywhere in childhood, full of that innocence.
