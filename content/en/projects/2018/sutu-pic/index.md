Sutu.com is a decentralized, open and transparent image copyright trading market based on blockchain technology. Here, creatives can display original images, share creative content, and trade image copyrights to meet the diverse original image needs of customers. All picture information, transaction records and authorization records will be synchronized on the chain to achieve relevant information traceability, so as to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties.

Our vision is to become the "Taobao" of electronic data products! We believe that the application of blockchain technology is expected to transform the entire digital copyright market, promote resource sharing, optimize the transaction authorization process, reduce platform operating costs, and build a trusted copyright system.

The underlying layer uses the [UPQ Blockchain Database] (.. /.. /2017/uchaindb/)。
