Brush War, game material extracted from the Japanese game of the same name, early 2004, three months, VB6+GDI, compiled using classroom computers,
I am very grateful to the students who played in the classroom at that time for their valuable suggestions for game improvement, and also thank the teacher for their acquiescence in this behavior

**Introduction**: This is a small and chic game software, edutainment, in the process of playing, can cultivate students' sense of time and hygienic civilization habits. At the same time, it can also build students' self-confidence and exercise students' willpower. In the competition, it can reflect the pursuit spirit of modern students who will never be left behind.

**Game Rules**: Brush Wars is a small multiplayer competitive game where you control your brush to move around the screen, eat power-ups, get more magical magical features, and then cover as many places as you can with your own color in a minute, whoever covers the largest area is the winner. In solo mode, control your cleaning tools to make our beautiful campus even cleaner. But your time is short, so you must hurry and act quickly!

**Technical Points**: This program is completely using API functions for picture display, in order to get a fast speed, the algorithm is specially optimized. Screen color area calculation uses the fuzzy calculation method to achieve better results.
Self-evaluation: This was developed in my spare time when I was in my second year of high school and thought I was fully proficient in VB. When I came up with this idea, I was happy for a long time. This gameplay is my own favorite and full of innocence.
