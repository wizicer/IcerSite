May 17, 2000 was a very significant day for me, because from that day, our computer was connected to the Internet, and then on Children's Day, I found the free space I dreamed of - a place where I could place my dreams on the Internet, and then used FrontPage, because of the experience of using Word, so FrontPage was very easy for me to get started, and soon, the first version of the website came out. The content, like many first-time website friends, provides some good things on the Internet to download, but I am a little more than them, and also provides my program to download. Of course, I didn't know anything about counters at the time, so it is impossible to know how many people have been on my website, but it should be very few, right? Hehe!

The winter vacation of the second year of junior high school is also very meaningful, and my website has been promoted to the "cool" level, but it is only when I see the website template provided by others when I wander around the Internet, so I downloaded it and modified it, but after all, it is very tiring to pose cool, indeed, it took me several days to cut this huge diagram into one by one, and then embedded it with JAVA statements, tired! But this time the content is more abundant, and almost all the things collected on the Internet are put on display, of course, my favorite astronomy expo is the first place. This time the number of visits is large, an average of fifty or sixty IPs per day, I am also very happy, not only because the number of visits is large, but also because many people download my software, and some people say, such a child can do this level is good, I know that others are praising me, but I know that the subtext is that this is not good enough, so I decided to keep my age open, so that later some people thought that I was an old teacher over forty.

During the summer vacation of the second year of junior high school, I learned to chat, and once, a netizen pointed out what was the meaning of using other people's templates, and I was very angry at the time, but fortunately, this anger turned into a motivation to design a "cool" website myself, and at that time, I was already very interested in PhotoShop, and I just found an opportunity to practice, so I used all the techniques I knew to design a cool website, and given the experience of making a website last time, I developed one by the way." GodSpeed Cutting" software is convenient for my website production, and it turns out that this really achieves twice the effect with half the effort. Just when I was worried that my website was doing poorly, many netizens agreed that my website was cool. The interface is much better, but the content is less, because of the stimulation of the previous netizen, I decided to put only my original things on my website, but pity my little bit, all taken out, and filled in a website. Therefore, the visit rate of the website is not even as good as the last time, but I think it is expected, but because my software, Glacier Reviews, still attracts a large number of teachers to visit, and gives me a lot of valuable opinions, thank you here.

Until the winter vacation of the third year of junior high school, the increasingly rich technology, so that I am more and more uncomfortable with my website, and finally made up my mind, revised, this time because of learning some Java, so that I can freely run in the HTML code, the web page has also made a qualitative leap, but because it was the time to meet the middle school entrance examination, the pressure of the third year of junior high school made me unable to take care of my website, the poor content made me lose a large number of repeat customers, fortunately, at that time because of the "Game Thinking and Production" I founded, It took a little sensation in the amateur gaming world that led to a steady increase in the traffic rate of my website. It was not until after the middle school entrance examination that I had the opportunity to continue the revision, of course, just expanded the content, and thus met many masters. One of the most proud is the cute little dinosaur, which was my first hand-drawn + computer-colored CG.

In the first year of high school, I was trained by our computer teacher, so I also knew a lot of computer masters, although I was the only one with a website, but I was still shy of my website that I couldn't get my hands on, so I did the fifth version of my website while engaging in the informatics Olympiad in the summer of high school, of course, it is the most beautiful in my opinion, and it is also the most technical, because it is made by ASP, and many special effects are programmed with JavaScript + VBScript. It has also been widely praised by my classmates. This time, with my own designed guestbook, I got closer to the visitor and got a lot of useful feedback.

The theme website of "Mars Exploration" is also made to welcome the "Fifth National Primary and Middle School Students Computer Works Production Activity", won the first prize of Chongqing City, the whole website appears very fresh, the pure color of the bottom, giving people a neat and beautiful, the main color of red can better reflect the theme of Mars exploration. The whole website has a lot of special effects written by JS and VBS, which have a lot of learning value.
