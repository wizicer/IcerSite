**Introduction**: If you are a beginner, you can query the code you need through this software to enrich your program, but also save the pain of Internet search, if you are a master, you can also enrich this software by adding your own code, so that the majority of programmers get more resources. Similarly, this software has a good online upgrade function, which makes it easy to get the latest resources, and even if you are offline, you can query the downloaded code.

**Self-evaluation**: This was made during the summer vacation of my sophomore year of high school, that is, while writing this album, to enrich my extracurricular life. This project was planned a long time ago, but for various reasons, it never started, and later, it took only three days to produce, and I was still locked up in the study during the day reading textbooks, and I myself was satisfied with my own coding speed.
