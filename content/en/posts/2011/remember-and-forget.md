Today I helped my colleague install office2010, there was an error, prompting that a service could not be started due to insufficient permissions, and could only retry or cancel the installation, which was a problem that had not been encountered before, so according to experience, let him quit the antivirus software and firewall and other software first, and then found that it was still impossible to continue, so I went to ask Du Niang, she told me to change the login account of the service in the system service, so this step was successful, but I was dumbfounded, Such a simple question, and the prompt is so clear and detailed, I actually did not think to check what the situation of this service is directly to ask Du Niang, on the one hand, there is not my computer, quickly solved the idea, on the other hand, there is a busy work, do not want to do too much by themselves, directly solve the idea early, but still in the case of such a clear prompt, not first by their own brain to think, but let Du Niang help me do this, such thoughts make me feel very depressed.

In the book "Shallow", the author mentioned this point of view, the current search engine has done so much for us that our memory is "outsourced" to the search engine, and then our brain is trained to not concentrate on processing fine work, but can receive a large amount of information flow at the same time as multi-core and multi-thread, and so the brain will habitually abandon a lot of information, so that our brain becomes a pure thinking machine that is good at forgetting, so the material for thinking comes from the search engine.

I don't know if this is good or bad for future humans, but for me now, I don't want to do this, I still have to try to overcome these effects of search engines on me, inspired by the friction of materials, not enough materials stored in the brain, can not design amazing works.

By recording this, I hope that this scene will not be forgotten in the future, and I will maintain independent thoughts and memories.
