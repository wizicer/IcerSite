After a busy day, reading many articles on the Internet, I feel that I have gained a lot of knowledge, although I have always hated doing repetitive work, but such a transfer is actually quite interesting to think about, because I have my own purpose, and my own principles, and then rely on these principles and purposes to "greedily" absorb nutrition online.

My principles and tenets are as follows:

1. I must go through the articles I want to add (without reading or verifying the code).
2. If you encounter very basic and simple code, but also very common code, you can write such beginner code yourself.
3. When reprinting, try to make the poems as easy for readers to read (for this reason, I have painstakingly formatted each article carefully for a long time)
4. The code is pasted into the VS.Net editor and formatted by VS Assistant for easier reading. (Some websites have interlaced lines in code, so I even moved out the "key sprites.") ）
5. Try to get the author information when the article or code is extracted, but unfortunately, there seem to be very few authors who are willing to leave a name, I use the same title to search in baidu and Google, and the search is the same nameless article, alas, I can't help it. If you find that your article has been reprinted by me and there is no copyright information, please notify me immediately, thank you ~~
6. After the article is reprinted, I can read the article happily. If you find a problem with the format, you can correct it immediately.
7. Since the purpose of my website is "to be the most convenient and practical C# thematic site", of course, I need to work the word convenience, all for the sake of users ~~

After half a day, I found some problems:

1. Many websites are like "dead stations" without some vitality, as if the whole website is a pile of fossils, only for people to enjoy, but lose the original vitality of the website.
2. Saw a C# theme website, at first glance, the website is really popular, each article has thousands of clicks, so I went to its forum to stroll, the result was a big disappointment, except for a few "buddies" of the webmaster, there seems to be no one else. Then I came back to look at it and found another problem, all the articles were clicked on thousands, but most of them were in a thousand and a few, and occasionally I saw a few in the thousand and dozen, and had to shout "So it is"
3. Recently, it seems to be very popular forum-style websites, all articles appear in the form of forum posts, and then netizens' miscellaneous questions, comments are also mixed in, the popularity is quite enough, but I feel that something is still missing, after all, the forum is not the whole website
4. Another more serious problem is that a considerable number of websites tend to be homogenized, search and search, thinking that they seem to be on the same website, because the style of these websites, the density of advertising, and even the type of advertising (which is the most shameful) are not much different
5. The enthusiasm for advertising also made me stunned, an empty website, there is no content, but there is advertising, I always thought that I had to have a certain popularity to dare to use advertising, and even I wrote "Placing Advertising Popularity-5" in my simulation management game plan, I don't know if I am lagging behind, or the world is changing too fast.

After reading so much, I started to feel a little confident about my website, because I think my website has the following advantages:

1. The entire website code structure is my personal design, without any reference, so it is really impossible to be similar, of course, I will continue to absorb the advantages of each website I see, for my own use, so that users have some familiarity. Such a unique website is more memorable for users.
2. Add code, add your own characteristics, that is, always adhere to the purpose of my website, to make users feel convenient, anyone will choose to use conveniently, as long as I have always adhered to this principle, then this feature of my website will definitely make more users come and go on my website.
3. With your own website code, you can modify it in real time when needed, so as to constantly meet the needs of users, and let your fate be in your own hands.

Hehe, I feel that I have a lot of nonsense, usually write articles also form a habit, feel that if you don't write a thousand words can not get the feeling, so the blog has been abandoned, because every time you have to spend a lot of time to write such a long article and then publish, busy and really can't get out, well, today is the end, tomorrow I will continue to change the program of the website, add some new features, modify some errors, of course, will add a lot of articles. Then stay tuned
