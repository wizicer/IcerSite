Today someone asked me whether he accidentally deleted things (not the recycle bin), whether it can be restored, I wanted to tell him directly, impossible, but my own knowledge makes me unable to be so perfunctory, but talking about the actual principle is too boring, so I use an analogy, hard disk is like a human memory, a memory you don't like, you may call it away, which is equivalent to deleting it, but you don't really forget this memory, forget maybe just the name of this memory, One day, maybe through a medium, or something, you can automatically restore the original memory, but it may not be complete, because some parts of it may be occupied by new memories, to make this memory completely disappear, you can only let the new memory completely replace the original, the hard disk of the computer is just that, before the new thing goes in, the old thing is still there, but if you want to recover, maybe the content is incomplete.

After speaking, I myself also felt a little strange, because I have always said that I am good at forgetting, forgetting unhappy things, so that I can face every day happily, but I really don't know if I have forgotten something very important that I should not forget, dreams are very peculiar things, it may lead me to find those fragments of memory, those fragments scattered in the brain that have been tried to forget, but will we believe in dreams?

The memory continues, and forgetting will never be forgotten ~~~~~
