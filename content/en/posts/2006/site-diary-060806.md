Yesterday I changed the website program for a day, and the above content did not have time to update, even the mood diary was not written on time, although I also know that almost no one reads, Khan, but it is not a good thing to develop such a habit of summarizing it more. Well, during the time of writing this diary, temporarily "return" to yesterday.

Today I changed the program for a day, but in the end it seems to have done one thing, that is, to let the Web Spider accurately crawl to my website, with the original structure of my website, because the directory tree is dynamically generated by reading data, so it makes the analysis work of the spiders difficult, and I apologize to all the hard working spiders.

In my free time, I sorted out the things on the hard disk and found a subdirectory of the game plan, only to suddenly remember that there was actually garbage placed here without deleting ~o~

Then I will talk about the origin of this pile of plans and the reason why they are rated as garbage, this pile of plans are downloaded from a website called XX Game Academy, from the website, it seems that there is really a rich experience and glorious history, and the university behind it is even more famous, just think like this, suddenly found that it also provides the academy's works to download, of course, without hesitation to go straight ahead, all the plans are downloaded in one breath, the beauty products are glanced, Anyway, there are screenshots, plus I'm not an artist, it seems okay.

Then with excitement deliberately vacated the facts, prepared an afternoon to slowly appreciate these works, the first one quickly finished, a little disappointed, thinking that they were really unlucky today, came to see such a bad plan, it's a pity that their teacher gave a lot of evaluation. Then look at it one by one, the speed of watching is getting faster and faster ~&~

But in ten minutes, I finished reading what I had prepared for an afternoon to read, and also depressed me for an afternoon, summing up, I saw a few problems:

1. This game development academy, which is known as the first in China (it seems that many game development colleges say that they are the first), seems to have only one planning instructor, all of them are his own comments, and most of them are good comments, of course, maybe this is a selection (very sweaty) planning.
2. All plans are written online game plans without exception, and the specifications of all plans are almost the same, but this is easy to understand, after all, they are all learning the same textbooks, but the fineness of this plan is between the plan and the plan, saying that it is a plan, it will definitely feel too complicated for the boss to see, and I can't see it; If you say that it is a plan, you will definitely feel that you don't know how to implement it when you show it to the program and artists. Pulling all the way down, most of the time I saw a lot of tables, containing many monster settings, it seems that this can't be dominated, right?
3. The planning project seems to be a collaboration of several people, many of them write who the artist is, but the pictures in the plan are all in the major games, the only one with its own website and also formed an XX studio is better, the pictures should still be a few of their own drawings, but unfortunately their website can no longer go up.
4. The typesetting work is extremely bad, extremely ugly, and really tired to watch, I really admire that their teacher can actually calm down and look carefully in this way (or directly give comments without reading it?). ）。
5. Hehe~ Finally, these so-called plans have made me more confident in my own plans. ^o^

Recently, I have been busy with website development, but I haven't developed games for a long time, and I am a little unfamiliar with my own development concept. I want to do a plan, so in this direction, I have always hoped to use the program to show my plan, not abstract text, I do not do the presentation layer of the program, only do the logic layer and data layer of the program, the presentation layer in the simplest way to present on the line, so that the most intuitive plan in front of everyone, I don't know if this way is good, can only practice to try.
