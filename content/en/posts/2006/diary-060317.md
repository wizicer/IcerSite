I haven't been on MSN for a long time, and looking at the cold space adds a layer of cold color, which really makes me feel bad ~~~

Looking at the only few logs left before, I found that the joy at that time has long gone, I never thought that the world would become so fast, and it is really not a very rare thing to fall off the college entrance examination, but in the case of already having the qualification for special recruitment, and the usual results are still good, and then fall off the list, even the 20-point bonus qualification is also bizarre and disappeared, which is really a very unwilling thing, but I am really not very suitable for this education method in China, Re-reading may be a bigger abyss for me, so things flow slowly.

I didn't want to think about these painful memories of the past, but the news in the news about the disqualified 20-point bonus that reinstated me this year reminded me of this, and then I would like to erect a tombstone for these memories myself.

The university where I am now in began to cheer for being promoted to a university, and many students also felt happy, thinking that they had laid a layer of security for their graduation and employment, I did not want to fight them, so I did not say what I really thought, we are here to learn knowledge, make friends, what is the university itself?

I myself have already had many units have wanted me during high school, so I have never had such and such worries about finding a job in the future, but I seem to be a lot freer, and I can let myself go to learn something that others dare not learn.

Messy mood, just take it out to dry, pay tribute to the busy life.
