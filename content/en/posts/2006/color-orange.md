```
Orange is the joy of harvest,
Orange is the rainbow of festive celebrations,
Orange is a bright afterglow
Orange is the last blessing of the sun,
Orange is our gentle encounter
Orange is the most beautiful gift God has given us.

The library sat under my ass like my home.

Although the teachers of the library still did a cleaning once or twice occasionally, the crowded library still brought a lot of dust. But there is an exception to all this, that is, in the library on the top floor of the library, almost no one goes, because it is either difficult and obscure professional textbooks, or bird-language books from various countries similar to reading heavenly books.

I'm sitting in the library now, but on the floor, which doesn't mean there aren't tables and chairs, and it doesn't mean I'm informal, but the floor here is really clean, and I mop it myself.

In fact, I am not very bored, so I will not go to the strange mop to mop the floor for no reason, but in this small library that is often not visited for days, there is often a girl sitting on the table and chair in this room to read, I have never liked girls very much and prefer to read alone, of course, I had to find another place.

I have loved reading books since I was a child, and I am often attracted by the wonderful world depicted in books, of course, this has not changed until now, but when I knew that the stories in the book were just made up, my heart was full of disappointment, and I felt that the things I had always dreamed of in my heart seemed to disappear in an instant, and I myself seemed to grow up in that moment.

I still like books as always, but I seem to have lost some confidence in real life, and more often I prefer to escape everything, escape to the peaceful place of the library, escape to the perfect world of books.

Even if I escape it, there is still one thing that cannot be avoided, that is, actual life, I use my not too stupid head to sit firmly on the throne of the top few in the department, the family is not poor, never have to worry about food and clothing, it feels like this is perfect, but another inescapable theme of college students, love problems, is always a troublesome thing.

The last buddy in our dormitory besides me took his girlfriend and said to me, "Break up with my current girlfriend (they agree that the library is my current girlfriend) and find a new one." Then as I flirted away, I could only sigh and then dive into the world of the book.

There are always too many tragedies in books, and although I know that there is a big gap between books and reality, and the chance of those tragedies happening in real life is almost zero, I still can't stop thinking about it. Moreover, rather than sitting on the side of the road watching beautiful women and then talking, I prefer to browse through books in the library and take them out and read them beautifully.

But things are always developing, and thoughts are constantly changing, I remember that the roommates in the dormitory that day discussed their girlfriend, "Her library beauty is too quiet, don't move anywhere, if it is not to pass by in class, I don't know what it looks like", his classmates also echoed, "The book has its own face like jade", and then continued to complain after a burst of maniacal laughter.

Although not much has changed, since then, I have occasionally paid attention to the girl who "snatched" my place in the library and can be seen in the library almost at any time.

The story is just like this, as peculiar as the ones I read about in the book, begins in such a simple context.

It's dark, specifically, it's been dark for a long time, but now the lights are turned off, it should be the time for the library to close, and I keep complaining about the administrator, why don't I come to notify or check, leaving me alone, sitting in the corner of the dark top floor of the library.

There seemed to be a lot of dark clouds outside, the moonlight could not penetrate in, it was too accurate to describe the current situation with five fingers out of sight, I slowly stood up, suddenly heard the sound of "Kata, Kata" very clearly, it seemed to be rubbing something, I stopped the movement of my body, while feeling the numbness coming from the legs, while continuing to listen to this bizarre sound.

I thought, is there anyone here who hasn't left? Or is a horror story that only appears in the book playing out, and I'm still the main character? Or the worst, I'm already starting to hallucinate?

When my heart was still groping for this, suddenly a little light came from behind the layers of bookshelves, and my heart couldn't help but tremble, and various horror scenes depicted in the book suddenly flashed in my mind, although the materialist worldview made me believe in this real world, but I still couldn't help but look around with some fear.

Slowly moving towards the bright light, through the layers of bookshelves, and finally saw this unexpected scene, standing in front of her, the girl who "stolen" my place.

She was now holding a lighter and fumbling with something from a small bag. Looking at this, I finally understood that the sound just now was just the sound of a lighter, which made me guess for a long time.

Seeing me seemed to surprise her, and then she lit the candle she took out of her bag and stood on the table, pointing to the seat opposite her and saying, "Sit here, see clearly." When I heard her say this, I realized that I had not put down the book I was still reading.

As I was thinking about this, I saw her move the candle a little toward the center of the table, that is, brighten the spot she had pointed to earlier, and after doing that, she looked at me again and said, "The chair is wiped clean." ”

I couldn't stay there either, so I naturally walked to the seat she was pointing to, and when I pulled out the chair gathered under the table to sit down, I suddenly remembered something.

So I walked over to the pile of old library supplies on the side, and while taking out what I had hidden inside, I asked, "Would you like some water?" ”

I didn't get a response from her, I don't know if she was too lazy to ignore me and acquiesced, but I still took out all the drinking supplies hidden here, took out two cups, took out a bottle of mineral water that had not even been opened, and filled two small water cups.

I brought the mineral water myself, but this water cup was found from local materials, and it seems that it was used for tea parties when the administrator was fine, and washed it together while washing the mop, so it didn't receive too much strange eyes. At that time, I didn't think much, but I just took two to wash, but I didn't expect to really use two cups today.

I pushed the small full water cup through the middle of the wax paper mark and said, "The cup I washed yesterday, the water is fresh mineral water." After speaking, he took it up and took a large sip.

She glanced at me, smiled, picked up her glass, and drank it gently.

I have never looked at a girl so closely, and found that she belongs to the small and delicate cute type, although it is not a big beauty, but she still has a bit of pose. Before I knew it, I saw her eyes and found that she was also looking at me, which made me uncomfortable, so I wanted to throw some topic to ease the atmosphere, so I asked.

"When are you going to leave?"

Perhaps it was my voice that brought her back to her senses suddenly, picked up the book at a loss, and stood up to separate our eyes. So I also saw the title of the book, "The Last Embrace", and out of complete curiosity, I tried to see the cover image of the book in the dim candlelight, until I was interrupted by her answer.

"Tomorrow morning."

I also thought about it, a little surprised, but it seemed to be expected for her, who had hardly seen the set of tables and chairs without her except when I came in the morning. So I continued to ask.

"Do you often read books here all night?"

"Not many times." She replied softly, seemingly like a ghost.

"Are there any people like me who are accidentally left behind at night?"

"Nope."

I wanted to speak, but I couldn't, because I saw that she seemed to be reading seriously again, not wanting to disturb her, and opened her book to continue reading.

The second candle had been burned halfway, and for such a long time, I didn't have much sleep, kept looking at the book, and secretly looked at her from time to time, and found that the tears on her face fell silently, presumably reading a tragic novel. "The Last Embrace", you can guess it just by looking at the name, and most of the end is a tragic ending.

At this time, she seemed to have finished reading the book, and fell asleep on the table, which was placed very casually aside.

I was thinking about whether I should go to sleep or read on, when she sat up again and said, "The candle is still in the bag, the lighter is there, I slept first." ”

"Then I'm ready to sleep too." I should be with you.

After the candle was extinguished, the moonlight magically shone in at this time, although it did not directly reach us, but through the reflection of the ground, I saw her beautiful long hair hanging down naturally, making people feel as if they had arrived in a magical country.

Looking at such a beautiful night scene, I can never sleep, lying on the table thinking about something, feeling that in this beautiful night, I fell in love with the beautiful girl in front of me, such thoughts are my own heartbeat, I have always been only with books, I seem to be imagining something, imagining those stories that I think can only appear in books.

When I was already about to fall asleep, I suddenly heard her cry, "Don't go, I'm cold, hold me one last time, okay?" ”

I have always woken up easily, and her dream-like cry really startled me when I woke up, looking at her lying on the table, there seemed to be no sign of waking up, it was still moonlight, reflecting the tears on her face, which was particularly moving.

I couldn't help but get up and draped my coat over her.
