I have always felt that I belong to the perfectionist, always hope to solve the problem perfectly in one go, of course, I can't do it, and I believe that no one in this world can do it, you have to go through a lot of ups and downs to truly achieve the perfection in the eyes of others, and the perfection of your own goal is the eternal goal.

I like programming very much, because programming is very simple, and what I think in my heart is naturally formed, and I have always hated complex things, but what I do now, in my eyes, is already very organized and simple, but it has become an extremely complex thing in the eyes of others, and sometimes I really feel that this feeling is very wonderful. If you think about it, no matter how complex things are, they are just made up of some extremely simple things, and slowly, little by little, they can quickly form a huge thing.

The feeling of writing articles and programming is very different, the speed of hitting the keyboard when writing articles is extremely fast, for fear of not being able to record the scene in the fleeting mind, constantly grabbing, constantly described, not feeling yourself, completely integrating yourself into it, can't remember your emotions, forget your purpose, only know to let your hands dance on the keyboard.

When programming, I always stop and think, sometimes frantically enter the program, as if I am brewing some sentences that can be understood by the computer, and then I can't wait to tell it, of course, I just want to think enough so that I don't have to rework too much in the future.

Sometimes I'm thinking about questions, thinking about my website, thinking about my purpose for making a website.

When I first came into contact with the website, I just wanted to follow the trend, a little fashionable thing, never considered the problem of asking others to visit, always satisfied with the process of making my own website, that simple operation can release the feeling of imagining in my heart.

Then began to design the software, so that the original kind of production and stereotype website into occasionally updated website, can be regarded as an improvement, but I am indeed very lazy, until now, very reluctant to do those repetitive actions, very much hope that everything I do is creative, of course, as I get older, more and more find that the original "creative" are just repetitive actions.

Later, the first time I used ASP to make the first dynamic website, it felt a little bit of a feeling, in fact, now it seems that the website is just a blog function, of course, the term blog appeared about two years after that. The website is done, busy is an excuse, in fact, in the end or lazy, always satisfied with the process of their own creation, I remember that I wrote a lot of articles for my own website at that time, but I have been lazy to upload, maybe this lazy person, I don't know if there are friends around, hehe, speaking of this suddenly thought of the translated article in my own document, it has been said that it has been transmitted to the current website, and you can also publish it on other websites when you have time, and the result has not moved so far. Fortunately, now that it is written here, I think I will not stand still, I should be able to see it tomorrow.

I don't know where the urge came from, and suddenly wanted to rewrite my website, because the current structure of my website is not suitable for making a general website, and it is not good to continue to expand downward, so it seems to be a step worth considering, although it can never be perfect, but if you do so, it will be one step closer to your ideal.

Leaving school is getting closer and closer, and after returning to school, things will grow exponentially, plus I have a lot of interests, it seems that this time is even more fueled.
