I have been busy with the development of the new website system, and I didn't have time to take care of CCSharp.Net, I went out for a meal today, talked to others about my website, and said my own prospects, but after saying it, think about it yourself, what is the chance that my wishes will come true?

Having said that, in fact, we still only know what the real chance is after really fighting once, and we have to rely on our own continuous efforts to continuously improve this chance, so no matter what the way back, I think I must stick to it and try to make this seemingly unrealistic dream lean on the edge of possibility. Even if it's just a passing moment in the end, it's worth chasing.

I came home very late, took a shower, turned on the computer, connected to the Internet, and was pleased to find that another netizen left a message, gave me an opinion, let me pass more original information, this I also want to ah, but I think my programs are too messy, are embarrassed to take out ugly, just when I hesitated and didn't know how to reply, suddenly saw another of his post, asked me a question about WebService, I was thinking, in fact, if many people are like this, it's not bad, While answering other people's questions, you can add an original tutorial. Oh, then again, that's a good question, I've never programmed with WebService, and I just practiced my hands.

I was still very confident in my programming level, and when I was hesitant to choose Java or C#, the day after I came into contact with Java, I had already programmed a typing game with a similar game interface, of course, I was attracted by the power of C# and chose C#. It took less than half an hour to get the program ready. After packing the bag and preparing to upload and answer netizens, the extremely depressing thing happened again, the server died, at first I only thought it was a "cramp", but FTP went to test even different and confirmed that it died gloriously.

Psychologically depressed, I really don't know what kind of server is good, cramps all day long, occasionally dead off the machine, how can this satisfy users, but now such a pocket traffic, I really don't know where to go. Hey, forget it, just look at the IP growth, and then try a better server.

The netizen who asked the question, I hope not to hang on the Internet waiting for my answer, I can only upload it to you tomorrow morning.

I have to hurry up and develop my system these days, otherwise it will delay this place for too long, and no one will come to see a website that has not been updated. Well, I have to try, but it's too late now, so I went to bed first, good night ~ ~ 0:57
