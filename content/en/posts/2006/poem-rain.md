```
The oblique wind drizzle rubbed his face lightly
 Silence and empty alleys stand us

There is no word, no words, only a deep gaze
 Full of desolation, full of melancholy, but without the warm sun of the past

The rain did not stop and hurried across the face
 The clouds did not stop and went away with the wind in panic
 The wind did not linger and passed by darkly
 Love does not stop slowly ticking the blood

It was so quiet that I could only hear the rain ticking
 The memories in my heart tumbled out

I can't hear the grayness of the sky, the smell of the wind, the softness of the rain
 Only feel the darkness of the heart, the smell of hurt, the pain of love

In this rain, there are no more words of the past
 Only this pale rain can be heard
```
