I thought that
As long as I follow your mouth for the future, I can truly obtain it,
Of course, this future can be a little distant and dreamy.
Even after passing the wait of time,
It still makes me feel that this vacuum future is a little sweet,
Oh, it turns out that this is the taste of longing;

I thought that
As long as you and I burn the passion of love, true love can last forever,
Of course, this passion can be a little fiercer, a little fearless,
Even after passing the wait of time,
It still makes me feel that this empty passion is a little spicy,
Oh, it turns out that this is the taste of memories;

I thought that
As long as I don't suspect you, I can keep your love,
Even if this love can come weaker and weaker,
But the wait of time,
Let me feel that this ethereal love is a little bitter,
Oh, it turns out this is the smell of disappointment;

I thought that
As long as I give everything I have, I can get your love,
Even if this love can come later, less,
But the wait of time,
It makes me feel that this unknown love is a little sour,
Oh, it turns out this is the taste of despair;

I thought that
My crying quietly in the corner can reach your heart,
Of course, my crying can be a little more thorough, a little hurtful,
But the wait of time,
It makes me feel that this lonely cry is a little salty,
Oh, it turns out this is the smell of rain.
