One of my favorite foods is chocolate, but I only eat pure chocolate in two cases, so often the pure chocolate sent by others has not been eaten for a long time, hehe, but now I am eating it.

Pure chocolate is different from ordinary chocolate, and many times it tastes bitter, but for me there are only two cases where it tastes sweet, so it is a rare encounter, ok, eat it...

Sometimes I feel very strange, my parents always count my absence, I want to ring my alarm bell, I can't be complacent, but I think it's very strange, generally when others praise me, I will be very cautious, I feel that my ability in this area is not enough, and I still need to work hard; But if someone else says I'm not good at this, I will be very discouraged and feel that I really don't have this ability; Could it be that this is the legendary inferiority complex??!! Sweat!
