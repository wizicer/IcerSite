Hehe, I haven't been in the school for three days, and I found that there are more people on it, and it seems that everyone is ready to return to school at the beginning, and it is going to be lively again.

I haven't been idle for the past three days and continue to write my games. Let me disclose the results of my work during this time:

! [](return-to-game-development/1.jpg)

This is a diagram of the database physics model, a total of 68 tables, I drew for four whole days, Khan, after all, it was the first time to draw such a large one.

In fact, this should have been what should have been done at the beginning of the system analysis, but I ignored it, sweated, fortunately no one supervised me, and later added it, but fortunately, this model was clearly remembered in my brain.

This time the database operation I used new technology, hehe, greatly improved work efficiency, the amount of code has also been greatly reduced, hehe, thank you for the power of high technology.

The input interface of the most basic information of the system, hehe, the system is still big enough.

Since I'm talking about my game, I'll introduce it by the way, hehe, the following excerpt is from the game's requirements analysis document:

> 1.4 Game Features
> 
> 
> 1.4.1 Inherit the essence of strategy games
> The essence of traditional strategy games has been completely inherited, resource gathering, castle construction, war and other familiar words in strategy games will run through the entire game, allowing you to play the game while also allowing your mind to have a storm of thinking, but also let your strategic mind have a place to play, gallop the battlefield, and obtain your own higher honor.
> After joining the network, alliances, diplomacy and other functions will also make the whole game more fun, and the player's interaction will jointly create a history of the other world written by the player himself.
> 
> 1.4.2 Rich resource types
> Dozens of basic resource types are designed in the game, and hundreds of products are synthesized by combining these resources, and the rich resource types greatly enrich the content of the game.
> Each player's castle may only be located in a few types of resources that can be produced, and in order to be able to produce high-level products, either occupy more land or trade themselves. This setting greatly enhances the interaction between players.
> Over time, new resource products will be added to the game according to the needs or the requirements of the "era".
> 
> 1.4.3 Custom Classes
> There are no longer restrictions on the classes in the game, players can customize their soldiers to wear different weapons and equipment, of course, different weapon and equipment configuration methods will inevitably get a lot of unexpected effects. This makes the game much more interesting.
> Players can constantly experiment with the configuration of weapons and equipment during the game, and the results obtained are either kept secret, or taught to others, and can be traded with others as traded commodities.
> 
> 1.4.4 Setting the era of innovation
> led by the most advanced players, through a lot of research, when all the technologies of this era are completed, the whole era will move forward, and into the next era, all low-level users will automatically acquire the "common sense" technology of this era, and the research speed of the technology of the previous era will be greatly improved.
The progress of the > era represents the improvement of research technology, and although the technology of the next era can be studied without entering the next era, the research results will be relatively ineffective.
> 
> 1.4.5 Country Setting
> Dozens or even hundreds of players can form an alliance, hundreds or even thousands of alliances can form a country, and the "era" in a country is shared.
> Just as an alliance can build a league castle, a country can build special buildings, such as statues of great men, national palaces, and so on. Of course, there will be many functions that ordinary castles do not have. Increased fun in the game.
> 
> 1.4.6 Battlefield setting
> The battlefield setting allows the number of players participating in the battle at the same time to increase to infinity, and the battle will not be instantaneous, it will be a process, in the process, you can also monitor the battle situation of your troops and make appropriate orders.
> There is a pursuit setting on the battlefield, and when the large army flees, if the foot strength is not as strong as the chasing troop, it is likely to be caught up and surrounded and suppressed.
> When a unit enters the line of sight of their castle, they will immediately prompt the player to take appropriate countermeasures.
> 
> 1.4.7 New trade settings
> Only more powerful players can build a competitive market, all players to trade, in addition to contacting other players themselves, generally can only trade through the nearby market, the market only provides information, when the player confirms the transaction, need to send their own team to trade or protect trade, the market builder will charge their own trade fees in this trade.
> When you need to transport more advanced goods and are not very confident in your troops, you can apply to the market builder for "bodyguard" delivery.
> 
> 1.4.8 History settings that can be recorded
> All tiles and each user will have a history setting, whenever he has done something big, he will record his own history, and when the player occasionally looks, he can find his trajectory in this game, those glorious years.
> 
> 1.4.9 Customizable region naming
> Each player can name any place in the large map, and one of the main features of the naming is that the specific battle location name will be written clearly when recording history, and it is convenient for players to call it.
> When multiple players name the same place, the voting system will be activated, and everyone's vote will determine the name of the place, after all, a place can only have one name. The game will also be limited to a certain range, and duplicate names are not allowed.
> 
> 1.4.10 More ways to play
> In addition to providing traditional web games, we also provide PC clients and mobile WAP methods, so that players can widely join the game, and users who have the conditions to use PC clients have a more convenient way to play.
> Our PC client will pay more attention to the interaction between players, so it can better integrate players into the game, and the game does not neglect to communicate with surrounding players.

It can be said that during this time, the development of the game has been relatively smooth, but I don't know why, today's mood is unexpectedly uncomfortable, maybe because of some words, but I don't want to think about it more, find my goal, and firmly go on.

Hehe, the above, that is, the nonsense of the insertion, then turn back to the topic, I want to do online games That is my dream in the second year of junior high school, at that time there were only a few online games, online games are synonymous with high-tech games, and now online games are flooded, a lot of shoddy manufacturing, do and do are the same, I also know that my ability is absolutely impossible to overthrow everything I have at once, but I can add my new ideas while imitating the current classic games, we are in school, Without the pressure of those commercial factors in society, perhaps we are the masters who can create a brilliant future.

Oh, so I have to go forward and create my own myth.

Dear friends in SJTU, if you are interested in my game project, please contact me, we still lack a lot of talents, welcome to apply.
Specific personnel needs:

1. Numerical planner (requires in-depth research on the design of online games)
2. A copywriter (must have enough good writing skills)
3. Three programmers (C# knowledge required)
4. 3 artists (required to have sketching and computer coloring ability)
5. Game test 3 (requires extensive gaming experience)

I don't know what else to write, thank you friends for coming, hehe. By the way, I wish all students more and greater gains in the new semester.
