There are still two nights to go, Chongqing is so cold, although it is not the first time to experience such air conditioning, but in the previous high school, there was still hot water available, but unfortunately yesterday even the cold water used to wash the hair, the hands were completely numb. Hehe, it's okay, persistence is victory, tonight I am left alone in the bedroom, I don't want to go back a little, I simply sleep in the office, the office still has heating, a few more clothes, it should be good. Hehe.
      As soon as I went to the intranet, I saw that many students had already arrived home, hehe, so fast. I'll do more things in the past two days before I go back, and I can play in peace when I go back. Ha ha.
