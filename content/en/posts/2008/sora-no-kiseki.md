I was moved by the drama, but I didn't expect this to be so good, and it became a masterpiece comparable to Gundam in my mind.

Continuing the journey of the second part, it is said that this one seems to have been designed with 40h of gameplay, which seems to be enough to play.

Just downloaded the game OST music and started to enjoy it.

By the way, I found that my only 40G hard drive has 10G music on it, hehe.
