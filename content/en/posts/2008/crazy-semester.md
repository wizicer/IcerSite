I found that there is a special function of the intranet that is not bad, that is, RSS can be imported from the outside, which is convenient, so it was published here and imported from there in the future.

The army of postgraduate examinations has begun to form, only at twelve o'clock in the evening to return to the dormitory, except for class time, even eat no one, feel so terrible, today inexplicable feeling as if we are one step closer to the time of being kicked out of school, as soon as this semester passes, the school will scramble to recommend us out, I am afraid that we will not land.

It is understandable that interprofessional students start to work hard now, but the three non-cross-major students who do not cross majors, do not cross schools and do not cross regions are also struggling to study is a little too much, after all, there is still so long, now it is so crazy, I am really afraid that I will not be able to survive in the future.

As for me, I just didn't have any pressure, just thought about learning a little more, and then found that what we had to learn and my interests still overlapped a lot, so I studied by the way.
    
This week is quite stressful, the Challenge Cup has an internal primary this week, the second stage of the game is going to be completed this week, and my mentor also asked me to hand him an essay, hoping that I can resist the pressure to do everything well.

This blog has been abandoned by me for a long time, really embarrassed, originally thought that I can have a lot of spare time, I can try to write some novels, or express more of my feelings when I am free, but because my own things are still too much, there is no way, only this, but now I have found some good aspects, I believe that the utilization rate of this blog can be greatly improved.

Our game group's blog is still closed for the time being, and when the next stage is completed and our game is more mature, let your friends who care about us know more about our team, our work, and our progress.
