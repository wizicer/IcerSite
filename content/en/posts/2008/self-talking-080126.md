It really wasn't intentional, I didn't know she was that fragile, and it was like this:

Last night, I went to the hot spring, it was so comfortable, and then, when I went back to the bedroom, I was the only one left on our floor, and the administrator also said to lock the door, and I was afraid that I would not be able to get out if I was locked inside, so I simply grabbed my clothes and went to sleep in the office.

The office is still quite good, there is air conditioning, but unfortunately our school's tofu dregs project, this building has only been opened this semester, the door is broken, can only be closed from the outside, the inside can not be closed, so I went to the toilet early, let the classmates help me close it outside, I was "safely" locked inside.

I woke up because I almost flipped off the bench, hehe.

In fact, the above is all nonsense, hehe. Now comes the point.

Although there is air conditioning, but this garbage project, the whole room is leaking everywhere, so it's still a little cold, no way, turn over, find that it's only six o'clock, really boring, don't want to do business, so I took out the things that were not done last time to do, modified my cute spider, put it on it and climbed, I went to read by myself, and when I came back to my senses later, I found that our academic affairs network was hanging, showing "memory cannot be allocated", so pitiful. Here's the thing, I've only collected 680,000 student information, and the most important thing has not yet been collected.

To explain a little, spider: It is a software to find information like Baidu and Google looking for websites, and my spider is used to collect information on the performance of all students. Simply put, my software runs too fast, the academic network can't bear it, hang up, I'm really sorry, I didn't expect the academic network to be so fragile.

In mourning...
