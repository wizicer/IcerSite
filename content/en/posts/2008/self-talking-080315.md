One-handed typing, hehe.

Today, I have been writing the program since I got up at six-thirty until now, except for eating, and suddenly I found that I said that I wanted to rest, but I had no other action except staring at the program in a daze. Suddenly remembered the school intranet that has not been used for a long time, hehe.

After eating the apple, continue to say two nonsense, the development of the game is progressing well, today I can already watch the ants grow slowly, and suddenly I have the feeling of raising a baby.

In recent days, I have suddenly become fascinated by neural networks and genetic algorithms, and I hope that in the future, my little ants can also be armed with this technology and become a group of smart elves.

Work is gone, friends are also cheering!!
