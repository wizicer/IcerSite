During the Qingming season, my mother went back to her hometown to visit my grandfather, and I also asked my mother to say hello to my grandfather on my behalf, hoping that he would still be as happy as a big child over there.

I went out to the river barbecue with my classmates and relaxed my mood, but because I relaxed, I was left with too much time to think about some messy things, which made my mood uncomfortable.

Too many past events, when it is time to ferment, mellow but mixed with drowsiness and bitterness, perhaps only when the wine completely volatilizes, can you feel the fragrance from the aftertaste left at the bottom of the bottle.

Or return to your own full life, forget everything around you, and live a life of your choice, without caring whether this life is comparable to other people's.

A string of miscellaneous thoughts, hoping to put an end to my chaotic thinking.
