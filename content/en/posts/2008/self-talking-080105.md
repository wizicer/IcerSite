Just finished writing a program, and then there is still a short distance from the meal time, the above is the reason for this text, hehe.

Somehow, I suddenly feel that my writing ability is becoming more and more degraded, and I used to write an article to express what problems can I express, but now the article seems to have become the latest running account, I don't know what to say, hey, forget it, after all, such a private place is a place to indulge your own heart, and it can be regarded as a garbage dump for your own soul.

In the past two days, I suddenly feel that I am so greedy, I don't know why, I always want to learn everything, I want to learn too much, it's not a big problem to be busy, anyway, I have become accustomed to a busy life, but because more things have reduced the fineness, speed and attention of doing things, which makes me feel very guilty.

Yesterday a new online game came out, and the word "fair" was seen on the advertising slogan, and I don't know when I started to scoff at these two words, and then evolved into indifference, hehe, anyway, now it seems that unfairness is very normal and necessary, otherwise society cannot be so wonderful.

Recently, I began to contact friends in the game industry, since entering the university, I have not produced a game, I always feel a pity, in the process of contacting the industry, I have ignited the urge to make games, but impulse alone is not enough, now is the exam period, although recently because the exam is very easy, but can not be completely taken lightly, so this thing is still only to be put in the holiday to do, hope to really form a playable game out.

Hehe, maybe I've been too busy lately, I haven't chatted with my friends and talked about my heart, so let's put the nonsense on this, everyone just smiled after reading it.

It's just that now it seems that there are a lot of things to do during the winter vacation, I really don't know how many things I can really do, and now it seems that I still have a lot of games that I haven't played, which is a pity!

Although the system analyst is over, but now go to find some books to see, the more I look at it, the more I feel ashamed of this name, I am still some distance from the real system analyst, my actual experience is really too lacking, maybe these two days are a little depressed because of this, hehe, I didn't expect to find out the crux of my own heart here by talking indiscriminately, hehe, very good.

But although I know the crux, but I don't know how to solve it, I want to learn a lot of knowledge quickly, in order to be worthy of the name of a system analyst, but time is really not enough, it seems that I am too eager to achieve quick results, haha, hehe, only take my time.

Oh, it's time, it's time to eat...
