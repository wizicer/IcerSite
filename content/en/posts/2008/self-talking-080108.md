       It's really weird, I can't figure it out at all, I don't know what's going on, I was still watching my TV series early in the morning, and I received three calls in succession, arranging my activities for this day, it seems that it is impossible for me to sleep during the day today. Hehe, forget it, it's not a big deal for me either.

I went to Yuzhong District in the morning to get things done, and came back to continue watching my TV series, I always thought I was a more cold-blooded person, so far, I have not shed a single tear for any film and television works, but I want to say that this is indeed the most water in my eyes, if I see the moving scene is exactly late at night, that is to say, when the students are asleep, maybe the tears will really fall.

When I was a child, I liked to cry, I don't know if I dried my tears at that time, since I understood things, I only cried once, at that time it was so sad, I shed tears for a girl, hehe, shame, don't say it.

The reason why I was so moved was because there were so many scenes in it that evoked memories and made me feel more immersed. I think that the older the person and the richer the experience, the easier it is to be moved.

"Surrender to a Naïve Girl" touched me a lot, touched my memories, touched my nerves, touched my thoughts; Let my memories be encapsulated and my thoughts precipitated. This is not a comedy, nor a tragedy, just a fairy tale, a beautiful sweet and sour fairy tale.

Hehe, I've finished watching 24 episodes, but I also have to hurry up and do my thing and start working overtime!
