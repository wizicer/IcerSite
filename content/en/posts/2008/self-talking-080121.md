It's very cold, today after the graduate school exam, I ate with my senior brothers, teachers and classmates, drank some wine, slightly drunk, hehe, so I came here to talk nonsense.

I didn't expect that after the exam, I would still be so busy, there was an exam as a cover before the exam, so I didn't have to do a lot of things, but not now, a lot of things to do.

Inexplicably, I think of something, maybe it's because of the struggle, thinking about my own things, I always feel uncomfortable, but I can't see where the problem is, it seems that I am dizzy, and I can't speak clearly.

Hey, it's still a poetic meaning

```
The sky is cold and the heart is quiet,
There is not much sleep after rethinking.
Fang wanted to mourn through wine,
But his thoughts were cloudy.
