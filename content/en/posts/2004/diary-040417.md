I have always despised the current MMORPG (online role-playing game), but I have to admit that I am indeed addicted to it, and I will be deeply involved in it, but fortunately, it also shows that I am still a normal person, and I can be attracted to these colorful worlds around me.

I haven't done anything "text" for a long time, I have been busy writing programs, looking at circuits, occasionally sorting out my hard disk when I am free, planning to play a certain game, but I dare not start playing, afraid that my time will not fill my game addiction at all, but I didn't expect that after seeing my classmates playing online games, I thought it was impossible to be addicted in online games, so I tried to taste this "Internet drug", so I inadvertently proved the classic conclusion, Numbers are quite attractive to anyone.

From elementary school, junior high school, high school to university, we have always been chasing a number, that is, ranking; Since childhood, we have always hoped that one number can become huge, that is, money; Every New Year's Eve, we calculate a number, and that is the New Year's money. Now in the digital age, numbers are better integrated into our lives, and at the same time, they are more ethereal, and can even make the "numbers" accumulated by a person for a long time disappear silently in an instant. Numbers are better integrated into our lives, and people are more worried about their lives, afraid that their "numbers" will suddenly disappear.

Not to be outdone, the movie pours salt on human wounds, revealing again and again that human beings are too dependent on numbers, so that human beings themselves cannot turn back again and again, and from time to time miss those simple and simple lifestyles that have entered history, but they can't let go of the existing convenient life. Once again, digital gravity has shown its own unique and powerful magic.

The topic is said farther and farther away by myself, and I feel that my thoughts are getting more and more chaotic, and it is more and more difficult to sort out, maybe it is the reason why I haven't done an essay for a long time, maybe it is also that the mind that thinks about the game data from time to time has allowed me to think too much, or maybe I am not used to thinking about problems before it reaches the night, and I always have to be affected by the surroundings and cannot concentrate on my own problems.

I remember when I was still in junior high school, I had ambitions to make an online game with images, but a year later, half a year after the legend was born, I was tired of this mode of online games, hoping that my online games could break through such a trap, but I still couldn't build a perfect online world, which could break through the existing various terms, which made me lose a lot for a while, and even hoped that I would never get involved in online game production
