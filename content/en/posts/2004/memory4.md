...... Slowly, I gained a little consciousness, opened my hazy eyes, looked at the scenery outside the window, a round of ice sun hung high in the sky, emitting powerful energy, with this energy, my mind began to work again, but it was some strange feelings, like a fountain of memories flowing in the brain, these memories were clear as if they happened yesterday, but strange as if they had entered someone else's dream. This torrent hit my nerves and made my head ache unbearably.

The movement of thinking accelerated my recovery, and my limbs gradually became stronger, just as I tried to move my arm, a warmth came from my arm, and I immediately stopped the arm movement, tilted my head slightly, and saw Senyun's beautiful face nestled on my arm, showing a hint of a smile, I couldn't bear to move anymore, so I calmed down to deal with my messy thoughts.

Slowly closed my eyes, and the moment I closed my eyes, scenes of red memories reappeared in my mind, a gloomy face, a beautiful and delicate face, a wave of heat with huge energy, a hideous body...

These strange memories attacked my brain, involuntarily, my body became a little trembling, until my eyes were opened by my force, the sky was still the same, the round ice sun hung in the sky, she was still lying on her side by my bed, I looked out the window in a daze, trying not to close my eyes and enter the terrible red nightmare.

Suddenly, an ice-colored piece of paper flew in, like a slowly falling snowflake, followed by a whispered sound of footsteps, and I saw Senyun rise in response to the sound and catch the falling piece of paper.

When I saw her get up, I got up and went to her side to look at the note. She stared at me in amazement with her tear-filled eyes, revealing a hint of relief.

I can understand her feelings, presumably I have been waiting here for many days, suddenly woke up, made her surprised and happy, but at this moment, the window flew into this mysterious note, making her confused for a while, I don't know how to be good, so I signaled her to look at the content of the note, so she quickly took a look, her face changed slightly, but she had handed me the note, and before she got it, the big words on the note had met my eyes, "danger is going quickly."

The mysterious note made me think a lot, but the moment I held the note, the paper condensed into ice cubes, then broke into many small pieces, spilled on my sheets, and finally evaporated into the air and turned into nothing. I was suddenly a little surprised to see this familiar magic and also a little confused, who would leave such a note for us, whether to help us or to harm us.

Sen Yun seemed to see my doubts and said, "Maybe it's a spy ambushed in the Chiyan Country, maybe he heard something." I nodded, I wanted to close my eyes and think about it, but the moment my eyes closed, a red face appeared in my mind, looking so sad, the red invasion scared me into a cold sweat, and suddenly there was some inexplicable uneasiness in my heart, for no reason.

Sen Yun's face became a little ugly, and he asked a little reproachfully: "Why is it that after you wake up, you always have this strange expression, as if you have lost your soul?" In the face of her rebuke, I didn't know how to answer, I didn't know how to behave, Mumu's silence, but involuntarily wanted to close her eyes, she seemed to see something, stepped forward to grab me, but my eyes were closed, a red flame burned in my mind, and a young girl was far away in this flame.

The eyes opened, I was shaken by the fierceness, Sen Yun was obviously also frightened by my safe open eyes, the two pairs of eyes looked at each other, only Sen Yun's eyes were filled with tears, she threw herself into my arms, crying and said: "You know what? During this time, I was so worried, I stayed here every day, watching your body emit ice qi for a while, and heat qi for a while. The last few words were said very heavily, and I could hear the deep worry, and I heard her words, and I felt strange, after I woke up, I always felt that as soon as I closed my eyes, I could feel a stream of Yan energy flowing by, and red memories followed, as if I was no longer alone.

Sen Yun's head has been buried in my arms, and the warm feeling has come from her, but the warmth I feel is more than this one, it seems to radiate from my heart, I stared ahead, trying to keep my eyes open, and then fell into deep thought.

I thought a lot, but I still couldn't remember what I had done before, so I let Senyun snuggle and think, until I thought of the note just now, I realized a big thing, I can actually recognize the words on it, and I can't help but tremble all over.

Sen Yun seemed to be frightened by my tremor, quickly sat up, looked at me gently, and asked, "Is there anything uncomfortable?" ”

"No, I was just thinking about the note," I was about to continue, but she interrupted.

"Don't think about it, rest well, and after resting, we will leave immediately." She looked at me with her innocent and turquoise eyes and said.

"No, I mean, I can actually recognize the words on it, it says 'Danger Goes Quickly'." Of course, I can't hesitate to say this, this is a great event, a big step on the road to recovering my memory.

With a surprised expression, Sen Yun stood up abruptly, and I was snuggled by him because I suddenly lost my center of gravity and was about to fall, at this moment, when I was habitually trying to prevent me from falling, I found that I couldn't exert a little strength, and it was accompanied by severe pain, and I couldn't help it, and let out a terrible cry.

Sen Yun saw me falling, so she immediately came to help me, but she still couldn't get ahead of me to make a call, and the moment she helped me straight, the door of the room opened, two guards broke in, looked at us, knelt on the ground, and said together: "What is the discomfort of His Royal Highness?" ”

Sen Yun immediately shouted to the two guards: "Go out, who let you in?" ”

The two guards glanced up, then hunched over, closed the door, and there were only two of us left in the room.

Sen Yun's eyes had changed from a trace of excitement just now to the usual sadness, still looking up at me like that and saying, "You don't have the strength to cast magic anymore," he saw my affirmative and somewhat disappointed expression, turned his gaze to the floor, and continued, "It seems that we are really in danger." ”

Then there was a long silence, the quiet environment was the most suitable for contemplation, very naturally, accidentally closed my eyes, red flames appeared again, as if to burn my entire eyelids, looming, the face of the girl who had appeared before slowly decayed and deformed in the flames. In an instant, I shook my head like crazy and opened my eyes, and the shaking head caused my body to swing, causing me to cross Senyun, who was snuggling, and fall on her legs.

The haggard face looked at me, tears dripped on my face, and I suddenly remembered that the liquid that dripped on my body many times was called tears, which were the crystallization of emotions. Suddenly, he said involuntarily: "I'm sorry." "For no reason, I just want to apologize, as if I owed her a lot in my previous life."

Just as I felt the warmth coming from her legs, someone was knocking on the door. She quickly lifted me up and sat up straight.

"I heard that the prince is awake, can we come in?"

I looked at Senyun, her empty eyes looking in the direction of the door, as if she didn't know how to make the next decision, but as a woman, under the constraints of such worldly morality, it is already very good to have such decision-making ability. Now she may have felt the edge of despair, and as a man, I should make my own decisions.

"Come in." I held my breath and said the words. She still looked at me with that sad look, and I smiled at her.

Two guards opened the door and guarded the two doors, and then three people entered, and the first one was the magician I saved, the Prince of the Yan Kingdom, followed by two people, who were already elderly archmages at a glance, guessing that the prince's attendants must not be bad, if there is a disagreement and make a move with them, we will definitely have no chance of victory.

After a long time, I also sorted out my thoughts for a long time, only to find that Prince Yanguo had not said a word, and he was looking at me like this.

In order to break the deadlock, I opened my mouth and was about to speak, but was interrupted by his words, "The prince is still unwell, so we will retreat first and not disturb." He didn't say this to me, but to his entourage.

After the door was closed, he heard him say to the guards outside: "Look, if there is a problem, only you ask!" "It feels like it's being said so loudly that it was said to the people in our two rooms."

I still felt weak all over, and although I knew that he was a little unreasonable, I couldn't help it.

Sen Yun leaned close to my ear and whispered to me: "Just now, he was full of murderous aura, but he seemed to have some concerns, he didn't make a move, we have to quickly find a way to escape." ”

"But I can't use my strength at all, you may not be the opponent of those outside, escape, it's difficult..." Although I said something frustrating, I still tried to think about how to escape.

In this way, the two of us still snuggled up like that, thinking about our own strategies, and the warm feeling passed from his arm to mine, and then into my heart, but my heart was still chaotic, and the feeling of Yan still did not give up the struggle, and the two forces of Bing Yan have been fighting, so that I can't exert the slightest strength.
