The next day, when I was ready to get out of bed, I saw her sleeping fragrantly on a table not far away, sleeping gracefully, like an elaborately carved stone statue. I was bored, so I walked to the door, and also wanted to see what was outside, so I opened the door, and saw that there were many machines outside, there were various instructions on the screen, but most of them turned red, I knew, this means that there is an alien intruder, I walked to the machine, as if there was no amnesia to operate, skillfully began to resist the foreign invaders, after a while, the intruder disappeared outside this strong fortress, I saw nothing, so I got up and walked back, but found her standing there dumbfounded, I didn't make a sound for a while, and finally I spoke, "Are you all right?" ”

"Ahhh... Yes...... Not... It's okay," she replied with a swallow, and after a brief thought, she continued, "It's okay, but they're already here, and I'm afraid it's too late if we don't move quickly." ”

"Is there a plan?" I can't wait to ask.

"Actually, this question should have been asked to you, because you personally repaired it here, and I don't know what way back you left behind." But now it seems that you can't count on it, why don't you go and see the machine, maybe it will be a little hinty, I'll go to the corridor and observe. "In this case, I think maybe I only have the ability to go and see the machine."

She quickly left the room, leaving me standing there alone, I looked at the machine carefully, very new feeling, it seems that there is no flaw, I had to sit down, look at the program stored in the machine, nothing special, are just some programs to manipulate the defense facilities outside the palace, but there is a program signed "pinball" that caught my attention, because I really don't remember that there was a weapon called "pinball", its description said "ancient game of another world", after entering the program, I found, It is indeed very ancient, the two-dimensional picture seems very vicissitudes, my habit is to look at its demonstration, in the demonstration, a magician sent a magic ball, touched the edge of the screen and bounced back, the magician moved, and then sent a magic ball to collide with the previous magic ball, so that the previous magic ball could not touch the wall behind him, it was indeed a very interesting game, and I couldn't help but play a few times.

Suddenly I heard someone behind me exclaim, "Ah", I turned my head and saw her rushing out of this small room full of machines, in the room has begun to renew energy, seems to want to break the wall, "bang", she failed, she sat down on the ground, I quickly stepped forward to help up, sat on the bed, she whispered "I checked, except for the main entrance, we can't get out, I saw your game, how much the picture looks like this room, I thought there would be some secrets in this wall, but maybe we were wrong." Her voice seemed to tremble, and droplets of water came out of her eyes and dripped onto my hand. As if I had been scratched by this droplet, an inexplicable pain arose in my heart.

After a while, the water droplets no longer flowed from her eyes, but she stared blankly at the wall. I don't know where the courage came from, I helped her to the table and sat down, then stood where she cast the spell before, and cast spells on the wall in the same way, although my mana was much higher than hers, but the wall was still unharmed, more infuriating, the wall seemed to have a defensive shield, and my mana bounced back almost completely, because I lost my memory, I had no combat experience for this kind of early on, and I didn't expect to be counterattacked by the wall, so I was not prepared to defend at all, I was hit by the wall behind me, When she fell, she quickly rushed over to pick me up and asked in a loud voice, "Is there anything wrong?" Hurt or not? ”

Immediately listened to the sound of the wall shattering, she helped me to walk away a few steps, and saw that the wall-the piece behind me, because I accidentally hit it, it shattered, and slowly revealed the world behind the stone wall-a long tunnel, thinking that there must be something strange in it, because the almost dull stone wall is so hard, and this shining sea luster, almost makes us mistakenly think that we can see the deep sea water from here, I don't know if this road is the way of heaven or the road of hell, But I think we can all be mistaken for something behind the hard stone wall, when in fact it is not too hard, and even makes people think that if it is broken, it will be invaded by the sea. If I hadn't been defenseless, I might not have been able to discover the mystery of this, but in fact, how many people would not be defensive? I think there will be light behind this path.

I think she cast her gaze and found surprise and confusion in her eyes. She seemed to sense that I was looking at her, so she nodded at me, and even if it was our tacit understanding, I didn't say anything. We stood up together and walked towards the depths of the tunnel...

I think we've been gone for almost a day, but we still haven't seen any other scenery, and if we didn't feel the temperature rising, we would really think that we were standing still, but for us ice mages, the heat is just as much torture. Fortunately, my mana is not weak, or I have to be buried here, for her in the Yanbing world, although it is slightly better than me, it is also a big test, but we still go forward bravely, because we have no choice, the main entrance is hopeless, we can only go this way, walking in this tunnel without seeing the edge...

My magic clock told me that the day passed again, the temperature was even higher, I couldn't help but look at her again, during this time, I don't know how many times I looked at her, I saw beads of sweat falling on her forehead, and the clothes all over her body were soaked with sweat, I knew that in order to maintain her physical strength to walk independently, she never used mana protection, I looked at her again and again, but the eyes she returned to me became haggard again and again, I knew that she was about to lose support, but from her eyes seemed to want to express, leave her alone, she can do it, but somehow, but I don't know how to use mana to protect her, she is just a weak woman. A strange thought swayed me that I didn't understand and couldn't control. Until finally she fell, it was a strange road, not only the temperature rose surprisingly fast, but also a strange feeling of energy getting closer and closer, we all thought it was almost the end, but the truth was so cruel, she fell first.

I knew that she was just dehydrated, for two days, without ingesting a little water, but losing so much water out of thin air, I wrapped her in my arms with a wide robe, so that she could get the cold breath in my arms, she slowly woke up again, so she wanted to go down and continue walking, I knew that she was no longer able, so I picked her up and continued walking, and she also settled down and began to cultivate. I quickened my pace because I knew my mana wouldn't last long.

Within half a day, I walked to a stone wall, expecting that this was the end of this tunnel, and the heat at this time made me a little unbearable, I put her down and cast a magic barrier so that she would not be burned, and then we were both stunned by the stone wall in front of us that spread a huge amount of heat, which was the most energetic stone wall in all my memory, but suddenly I found that the energy did not seem to belong to this stone wall, so I stated my thoughts to her, "I feel as if on the other side of the stone wall, there is ... Oh no, it's two, two huge energy masses, it seems that two people are fighting against each other..."

"Could it be that your brother chased you here?" She was protected by me and could not feel the energy mass, so she had to ask me questions.

"No, these two energy masses are inflammatory, and my brother must be ice like me, so it should have nothing to do with us."

"Oh, that's good, but I don't think we should go out now, we are exhausted, if we start with them, we will suffer, it is better to wait and see here, so as to reap the benefits of the fisherman, wait first."

"Okay" I have always followed her arrangement, so there is no objection, so I can only recuperate, but how can I rest in such a hot heat?

About half a day later, I saw that these two energy masses showed signs of weakness, so I immediately told her, "They all seem to be a little tired, should we go out?" ”

She seemed a little hesitant, because she couldn't personally feel whether this energy was weakened, but she seemed to feel the weakening of my mana, and she knew that if we didn't do it, we might not be able to break down the door, so we could only promise, "Okay!" The tone was very reluctant.

I gathered enough mana and opened the door at once, I found that this door was like a void, and it opened when touched, and it caused me to use such a large amount of mana, but fortunately, the mana was large enough, otherwise it would be impossible to hold off a hot wave, as soon as the door opened, the temperature increased exponentially, and I understood that the role of this wall was only to resist this powerful heat, and now the place where we are is the bottom of Chiyan Lake - an extremely hot place that high-level Yan magicians dare not imagine, and it is also the place where the highest Yan magicians practice, It also often poses a threat to their lives. The person in front of him seems to be the same, who has been scarred by the bubbles that have emerged from this lake, and has been defeated one after another, and it seems that he cannot escape, and sweat has overflowed his forehead, which seems to be impossible. I think that the person who came here must not be a simple high magician, if I saved his life, maybe we can be saved, otherwise I can not be able to live here as an ice magician. Thinking about it, he immediately charged up mana, and healed the injured magician with one magic, and another magic rushed straight to the lake energy mass, this ice energy was very beneficial to the magician at this time, the person seemed to find himself saved, and before he thought clearly, he pulled out his legs and left, the lake energy mass seemed to be frightened by this sudden attack, and stopped all movements for a while, I found that the blow just now inadvertently weakened the protection of her, and the shame could not help but bury it in my heart, so I immediately hugged her, Follow the route that the magician escaped.

Unexpectedly, the magician fled very quickly, and we didn't have long to follow and lost, I thought to myself: Fortunately, the temperature is far from before, I believe that my residual mana support is still okay here, she is not in danger of life, there is nothing to rest assured, so I was ready to immediately set off to find the way, but suddenly felt a stream of heat approaching me, until finally I found that they turned out to be the guardian monsters of this layer.

Guardian monsters are actually magicians who practiced here before, but because they died here because they were invincible, all magicians who died here can fulfill a wish, most magicians want to kill those monsters who killed themselves to avenge their hearts, so they are resurrected here, of course, as guardian monsters, so they can personally kill the guardian monsters who have killed themselves before, the reason why they are called guardian monsters instead of guardian spirits is because they are deprived of the freedom to leave here, and they are sullen all day, They will do their best to kill everyone who comes here, without mercy, their minds are no longer so normal.

Those guardian monsters screamed and laughed, some seemed a little panicked, maybe they hadn't seen ice magicians come here, but I knew that I didn't have any ability to deal with them, maybe I really had to resign myself to fate, so I picked her up, wrapped her in my wide magic robe, and gently said to her: "Sleep, when we wake up, we will see Lanlan's sunshine" After speaking, I exhausted all mana and froze the two of us in the ice, I saw many guardian monsters approaching tentatively, and finally died the moment they touched the ice, and my ice cubes also melted off partially, and the moment the last freezing was completed, my hand felt the strange water droplet, and before I had time to think, I went into a long sleep...
