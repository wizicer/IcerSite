When I woke up, I was already sleeping in a warm bed, warmth was not a good thing for me, but it was better than feeling the overwhelming heat at the bottom of Chiyan Lake, I turned my head and looked at this room, it seemed that this was not an ordinary room, the roof fell like a fire snake-like flame palace lamp, all kinds of inflammatory tea sets on the table, overflowing with a burst of heating, crimson sunlight from the windowsill directly on the bed where he slept, the intricate statuette at the head of the bed, seemed to exude a kind of aura. It seems that this is already in a foreign country, and it seems to have arrived in someone else's royal palace, at least the noble's house. I tried to roll over and get up, then I suddenly realized that she was still sleeping in my arms, I quickly got up and let her sleep on the bed, I cast defensive magic, and began to check her injuries, fortunately not serious, but her arms and legs were burned a little, I used magic to remove the excess heat from her body, life will not be a problem, so I sighed, and then found that there were several people standing behind me, one of whom I knew, the magician who was rescued at the bottom of Chiyan Lake, he stepped forward and bowed to me, Then he said something to me, but unfortunately I didn't understand, but I must have said something to him so politely, so I bowed to him in the same way as the Ice Tribe etiquette—strange to say, forgot everything, just couldn't forget this—but didn't say anything, because I could say that I couldn't say anything at all, and I was completely dumb. Next, he said something, and made a gesture to let me go first, I think he wanted me to go to the hall to chat or go to the banquet, but I couldn't understand a word, wouldn't it be laughed at, I thought she would understand, so he walked up to her and tried to wake her up, but she never woke up, the magician patted me on the shoulder, said something, and then shook his head slightly, I thought, what does he mean? "Didn't save it"? , "Nothing"? Well, the more I thought about it, the more confused I became, and then the magician said a few words to me, and left, not knowing what he would say, "She woke up and went to him"? "Think about it and go to him again"? It's hard to guess, hey, him, wait until she wakes up...

"Brother Glacier, Brother Glacier, you don't care about me, don't care, go quickly, there is not much time left, I'm fine, she... She...... In the middle of the night, I was woken up by this sudden shout, and I was very surprised, I don't know what she is talking about, is it just a dream? Or my lost memory?

It was still dark, and the fatigue of this period of time forced me to ignore this for a while, and I fell asleep again...

The next morning, she seemed to wake up much earlier than I did, or that sleeping on the table was always later than the bed, and when I opened my eyes for the first time, she came into my field of vision and said, "Are you awake?" This is the iced tea I made, and I drank it cold. ”

I stretched my sore muscles and bones, took the tea and savored it, although the taste of this tea is much worse than the tea during the period of recuperation, but after such a long period of heat, it is really rare to taste such a cold and cool tea, I savored it carefully, and told him about yesterday by the way, "I can't understand a word of what they said, I'm afraid..."

"Nothing, I understand, I can be your translator." Just now I asked the guards here, we are now in the territory of Chiyan Country, and this is the royal palace of Chiyan Country, and the one who almost died at the bottom of Chiyan Lake that day is the prince of Chiyan Country, and today the king will set up a banquet to receive us. "Her heart is really fine enough to get things clear so quickly.

"Will they be against us? Isn't the Cold Ice Country and the Chiyan Country incompatible? "I was a little worried because my amnesia made me have no idea what the countries are like today, and I have to ask.

"You don't have to be afraid of this, you are the person with the highest magic power in the Cold Ice Country, and the only one who has been to another world, just based on this, they dare not touch you. In addition, you are the prince of the Cold Ice Country, and I am the princess of the Yanbing Realm, and with our status, they dare not disadvantage us. She spoke a little excitedly, but what she said did make sense.

At this moment, the rescued magician, the prince of the Chiyan Kingdom, walked in, said something to me, and smiled at me from time to time, of course I didn't understand, then she immediately came over, interrupted him, said something to him, and then the prince left, and I quickly asked her what the prince said.

"He just said something to praise you, and then he said that they had prepared wine and food and wanted us to go to the feast." She said unhurriedly, while still collecting the iced tea she had eaten.

"Then how do you answer him?"

"I told him, let's clean up and come right away." She seemed to have finished cleaning up, straightened up, and continued, "Let's go, he's still waiting for us, don't be too far away from me then, I'll translate for you." ”

"So sooner or later they will find out, so why don't you tell them the truth directly?" I was a little afraid that it would be embarrassing if I was discovered, especially since I didn't even know what they were saying.

She thought quietly for a while, nodded, pulled me out the door. When she saw the prince, she went up and said something, and then the prince looked at me with surprise for a moment, then smiled, and then led us to the palace.

This palace is really majestic, but the almost all red color makes me a little annoyed, there are four rows of soldiers standing in a hexagonal shape in front of me, they only stand on four sides, the remaining two sides are just left for people to walk through, when we passed, four rows of soldiers brushed and knelt on the ground, it was really spectacular, entering the palace, seeing that there were already many people sitting inside, and the king seemed to have been sitting and waiting, usually, this kind of banquet, is the banquet people to the banquet after the arrival of the king to invite the king out, and this time the king came out so early, This shows that the king attaches great importance to us.

When the prince led me to sit down at the upper guest table, she also sat next to me, and then the king stood up, smiled slightly, and said something to her, and as soon as she wanted to reply, the prince took a few steps and said something to the king, and then the king nodded and sat down. During this time, I was inexplicable, taking advantage of their father-son dialogue, I quickly asked her, "How did you tell them?" ”

"I told them that when you were practicing peerless divine skills at the bottom of Chiyan Lake, you were attacked, resulting in the loss of part of your memory, and that part just includes language, don't be afraid, they won't be bad for us. You won't be incomprehensible, I'll translate it for you. ”

"Well, if it's really going against us, we can't escape."

She was just about to call me back, but the king spoke, so she stopped. The king gave the order to the guards very solemnly, as if to ask the guards to fetch something, and after a while, they brought a large ding, and several people together moved it with great difficulty.

The king began to speak to me, and she began to translate for me, "Listen to me, Prince Edward was accidentally injured to the point of amnesia. This is one of our country's treasures - the water of memory," saying this points to the big ding, the water in the ding is clear and visible, but you can feel that there is a strange energy in this water, but I always feel that this energy is familiar, but I don't care, maybe it's just that I am relatively new to the energy of Chiyan Country, so every energy I feel has a sense of similarity. He continued, "The energy in this water can restore your memory, you just need to drink a little, and you're good to go. With that, a guard handed me a full glass of water of memories and stood on my table.

Unexpectedly, at this time, she seemed to be a little excited, and began a conversation with the king, obviously hearing a little hostility, I think she must be afraid that the king would poison the wine, so she pulled her down and said, "It's nothing, if they want to harm us, they will already be harmed, why wait until now?" Besides, how could a glass of poisoned wine easily take my life? Nothing, I drink. As soon as she saw that I wanted to drink, she immediately reached out to stop it, the glass was knocked off, but it had already been drunk by me, she looked at me with dull eyes and said, "Your memory cannot be restored, you are..."

Just said this, I felt that the huge energy in the wine had begun to work, my legs were soft, and finally I fell, she saw me fall and immediately stepped forward to support me, shouting, "Brother Glacier, Brother Glacier, you don't want to be fine, I told you not to drink, Brother Glacier, Brother Glacier..."

I already have no strength, my whole body feels very tired, I want to sleep, but the moment I closed my eyes, my face felt a drop of water, strange and inexplicable sadness, but before I could feel the feeling of the water droplet, I had lost my feeling...
