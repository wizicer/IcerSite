## Frontispiece

After my computer Olympiad, in a sense, my high school years were over, and all that remained was the college entrance exam to exercise willpower. Although the sky is stormy, the students are laughing, but I am the only one talking to myself here.

"Programming is my life, human life is destined to be programming", this is what I said when I wrote my first game in the second year of junior high school, and now that I think about it, I really can't do without the program now, but I still can't stand the test of the battlefield and fall on the cruel battlefield. No tears, no blood, only faint laughter, a burst of self-ironic laughter, am I so worthless? In the third year of junior high school, I went to participate in the physics competition as the most promising player, but in the end, our school broke the honor of first prize every year; In my second year of high school, I became a seed player in the teacher's mind, but this informatics competition broke the honor of our school having winter camps every year... With all this, how can it not make me sad and discouraged?

> "Life, move forward with confidence!"

This sentence encouraged me, flipped through the awards, and a beautiful scene appeared in front of me: in the sixth grade, I scored a perfect score in Olympiad, and I heard the math teacher boasting about me in the office; When the third year of junior high school was re-encouraged, the teacher's enthusiastic encouragement still echoed in my mind; In high school, the teacher's tireless teaching and seductive reminders often made me "turn happiness into motivation"...

> "Greedy for fruit, missed flowers"

Tagore's words profoundly reveal those things that I once did not understand - the process is often more cherished and nostalgic than the result, my two-year Olympiad career is over, but in the process, the joy after solving some small problems is still present in my heart, I do not regret the effort here, although there is often double pressure from teachers and parents, but it makes me more mature, and better yet, it makes me develop software faster, and I am more worthy of the title of program magician.

It was all over, and I put together most of my work as a summary of my teenage years.

### My programming life

Program to me, like a dream, the sixth grade when I first learned programming, from the simplest program to be able to make a small game independently, the excitement and happiness in it, I'm afraid only I can feel, but the dream always has to wake up, so I felt the pain of losing hundreds of programs written by my own hands for the first time, which was a blow and a motivation, so that I gave up QB and turned to VB, one by one new terms came to me, under the baptism of bullets, I grew up slowly, and I was more disappointed and moved.

I remember when I was in junior high school, I thought that I could develop an online game by myself after high school became easier, maybe the picture was not good, but the technology must be the best, and I flew into high school with this bubble of good wishes, and then burst.

Under the vision of this wonderful programming life, I began to study the Olympiad in Informatics and became a recognized powerhouse, but I was saddened to lose many battles in the competition, because I thought that my technology was already above it, but it made my program development smoother. It seems that I will still go on this road for a long time, a long way ...
