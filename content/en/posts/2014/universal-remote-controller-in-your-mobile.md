> Turn your phone into a universal remote control without worrying about a bunch of remotes

This is the advertising slogan of a certain manufacturer's smart remote control, and it is this advertising slogan that makes me cry and laugh.

Things still have to start from my own want to make the home more intelligent, now the more popular wireless control is nothing more than the following:

** ** infrared**, ultra-low cost, directional, completely unable to penetrate the wall
**Bluetooth**, lower cost, can barely penetrate walls, but short distance
**Wifi**, the cost is average, the ability to penetrate the wall is relatively OK, the power consumption is large, but the transmission speed is the fastest
* **Zigbee**, the cost is average, the ability to penetrate the wall is strong, the distance is long, and the power consumption is small
**315M** or **433M** RF technology, lower cost, okay wall penetration ability, low power consumption, low information transmission

Now many makers have hit the idea of Wifi and connected all kinds of devices to Wifi, whether it is light bulbs, sockets or even water cups and refrigerators are connected to Wifi, but I have to say that the power consumption of Wifi is relatively high, which makes Wifi applications actually quite limited. Especially for environments that do not require large amounts of data transfer.

For ordinary home control, it has to be said that infrared is a good solution, as a one-way control without the need to collect data is indeed quite suitable.

It seems to be a bit off topic, my original intention is very simple, that is, I hope that there is a way to make all kinds of traditional devices at home intelligent, just **intelligent**, not **mobile**, so before doing Taobao, I hope to be able to find something like this:

* A device that can be connected wirelessly to my computer, and I can read or control other devices connected to the device through some standard API;
* Some other switches that can be controlled by the device, which will be responsible for turning traditional electrical appliances without interface control functions into devices that can be intelligently controlled;
* The control equipment should support recording and playback of ordinary infrared remote control buttons to replace traditional remote control;
* The control equipment should support remote control using infrared/Bluetooth/315M radio frequency technology;

Well, with the above my thoughts, I searched, but found some interesting phenomena, the vast majority of businesses are doing some independent components, such as the aforementioned wireless sockets, wireless bulbs, etc., only a very small number of businesses are doing routers in the intelligent control world, and the few searched for lack the last function I need, that is, you can use remote control to directly control, so there is the scene at the beginning of this article, Every merchant wants to integrate all existing remote controls into the mobile phone, but opening the mobile phone to operate this is an extremely troublesome experience.

In the end, it seems that I did not get any conclusions, that is, what I want is not yet on the market, maybe I can consider buying some modules to make one myself.

Well, today is really just a spit article, if you have any ideas and suggestions, welcome to talk to me.
