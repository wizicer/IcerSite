The recent smart home battle is hot, a lot of hot money has poured in, I believe that the partners who work hard in the smart home industry must be working hard. No matter which industry will grow by leaps and bounds once a large amount of hot money comes in, just look at the rapid development of our mobile phones and the steady development of computers.

Although small players in the industry have shown a greater sense of crisis, they are still unwilling to give up their own fields that they have been working hard for a long time, and this perseverance is commendable.

I don't have to stop talking about it here because of the popularity of smart homes, on the contrary, I am very happy to see the thriving development of this industry field, and I sincerely hope that one day the smart home kit built at home can be replaced by a mature and popular kit on the market.

There was a previous article talking about the current manufacturers to replace the traditional button remote control with mobile phone control, is really not friendly enough for users, today let's casually think about whether there is a good solution?

## How about 3D printing your remote control?

No longer a bloated manufacturer's own remote control, no longer have complex buttons, no need to place multiple remote controls in the living room, but also support more complex scene modes, the only thing to consider is what buttons on each remote control are commonly used buttons, and then through 3D printing technology, your own layout of the remote control printed, assemble on the mass production circuit board, it becomes a most suitable for your operation, your own unique remote control.

Compared with those applications that integrate various remote control functions with mobile phones, the biggest advantages are two: first, they are on standby at any time, without you having to launch the application, and there will be no annoying advertisements or upgrade reminders; The second is the physical button, which is very hand-feeling, and there is no need to stare at the mobile phone screen.

Some people may ask, if you want to integrate all the functions of all remote controls into this custom remote control, wouldn't it be very bloated? But if it's not integrated, how do you do it?

It is indeed not necessary to integrate all the functions into this most commonly used remote control, this should only be the integration of all the most common operations, for infrequently used operations, one can be carried out with the original remote control, and the other can be replaced by similar mobile applications mentioned earlier.

## Technical breakdown

### Hardware: Remote control physical structure

The remote control is disassembled, mainly silicone buttons, front panel, back panel, front gear and battery back cover, in addition to the material particularity of the front gear (excellent infrared light transmission), other parts can be produced using 3D printing.

If there is a certain scale, some parts can be standardized and mass-produced, for example, after several fixed sizes, the back panel and battery back cover of this size can be mass-produced.

Silicone keys can also be mass-produced in some shapes, and later printed with flower patterns by silk screen printing to show different functions.

### Hardware: Circuit board

Since this remote control does not need to be programmed at the remote control end, a more common chip can be used.
However, it is necessary to reprogram the remote control, that is, to customize the button function twice, so a chip with the programming function is required.

### Firmware

### Software: Client

But then again, this thing really has no technical content, the design of the remote control of the industrial designer thing, the core chip is a semiconductor thing, ordinary circuit board design, just find a small workshop can easily make,
