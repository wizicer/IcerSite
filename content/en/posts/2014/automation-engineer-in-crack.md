Software people in the industrial control industry (quite long, let's refer to it as 'industrial software') always live in the cracks, if you are a labor soft, let's see how many guns you lie on:

** Do not have automation professional knowledge **, do not know the concept of automation engineers, can not understand ladder diagram, do not know what the rail is, the understanding of PID control is only limited to knowing the basic principles and formulas, if asked how to optimize, must be confused. The point is that in this case, the software is still creating a ladder editor, and writing PID optimization algorithms according to development requirements, and they are asked why the optimization effect is not good? Obviously, this optimization algorithm is what you gave me, I am only responsible for implementing it in C language, and I am not responsible for algorithm design. Well, in such an environment, the software workers are doing their best to do the programs they don't use, and then they are questioned why they can't be better.
****Limited information**, in the circle of friends, everyone is discussing all kinds of Internet anecdotes, no one cares about what happens in your industrial control field, automation friends are frantically spinning various PLC programming tutorials and controller circuit design, that is, no one discusses with you how to write a new PLC programming interface or PC management module design.
****The technology is outdated**, in order to stabilize, the company does not dare to use new technology, even Microsoft does not support XP, and the software has to continue to do many additional test projects to support the operation. The leaders always say that we want to be the Apple of the industry, innovation and innovation, but really new, and afraid, the interface is new, afraid that automation engineers will not adapt, new concepts and afraid that engineers will not understand, new technology and afraid of instability.
** Unable to develop agile, almost all classmates or old colleagues in software companies talk about agile development, whether they really achieve agile or just have a very strong desire, after all, everyone is practicing the cutting-edge, imaginative future direction of the software industry. The brothers of the test group also said that they will only test your mature version without problems, because they are responsible for testing the reliability, stability and quality certification of the whole machine, and the brothers of the requirements group said that you should understand the requirements and tap the requirements yourself. Well, software is always omnipotent, understands requirements, does tests, and can test or simulate themselves when the hardware is not ready.

So the software is a group of people living in the cracks, and once a Microsoft interviewer knew that when I decided to go to the industrial field, he said that as a pure software engineer, you will definitely return to the software industry in the future. At that time, I really didn't think that several years of soft work experience made me agree with that point of view, but anyway, since I am already in this industry, it is up to me to lead a revolution, renovate the entire industrial control field, and integrate the spirit of the Internet into the industrial control field.

Software are essentially software engineers, but they are very different, do not use the most fashionable technology, the business knowledge that needs to be understood is extremely complex, extremely easy to be confused with automation engineers, so software always lack an effective way to communicate with each other, so I open this account hope to get to know more software and discuss and share bits and pieces in the industry with you, and let you see how I try to bring the spirit of the Internet into the field of industrial control, and let everyone witness together, See how this works.

Careful readers may find that the avatar of the account is a smart home meaning, so my views will be interspersed from time to time to consider how to apply mature and stable ideas and technologies in the field of industrial control to the field of smart home.

For the operation of the account, I am ready to push three original articles a week, including complaints, views and tutorials, after all, most of the content pushed is not purely recreational in nature, it is necessary to think deeply and verify, so it is inconvenient to be too diligent, the normal situation will be pushed every Tuesday/Friday/Sunday, welcome everyone to supervise and encourage, I will actively answer every friend's questions, so friends are welcome to send messages and communicate more.

## Answer readers' questions
Q: Don't figure out what this account is doing?

A: I mainly discuss with you about industrial control, smart home and the Internet, and let you see how I use Internet thinking to transform the current industrial control field.

Q: I didn't understand the WeChat public article written by Markdown.

A: Sorry, I didn't take into account the nature of WeChat's message push and some of WeChat's limitations at that time, and I published the article that needed to be iteratively updated with my inertia thinking. In order to stay up to date on progress, you'll need to log in to the project's [github page] (https://github.com/wizicer/wx-article-starter) to get the latest information, which will continue to improve as I continue to write articles on the WeChat public platform. When the project is stable, I will publish another tutorial to tell you how to use it, so stay tuned.
