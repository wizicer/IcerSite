Suddenly, I heard some noise outside the door, which seemed to be the sound of someone falling to the ground. I could feel that one of Sen Yun's hands quickly took it away, as if it had been placed on his dagger, ready to fight.

The door was gently pushed open, and slowly came into view a man wearing an ice-colored vestment, the wide robe covered his face, but his figure was slightly short, and he felt that this robe did not seem to be made for him.

However, such a vestment does not look like it can be worn by ordinary people, no matter how you look at it, it has a royal smell, and under the light of the ice sun, it looks particularly bright.

The struggle between the two forces of Bing Yan made my thinking speed significantly slower, and while I was still admiring this gorgeous outfit, Sen Yun had already drawn his dagger and stood in front of me.

But it is still very quiet, such a moment, if the person wants to explain his intentions, he will explain it; If you don't want to explain, asking him is tantamount to nothing. The air in the room froze in this atmosphere. The man was looking at me, and although his head was always a little dizzy, I could still feel his gaze.

Slowly, the air in the room began to flow, and the person who came slowly knelt down, and said in his mouth, "The subordinates are ordered by the king to hide in the Chiyan Kingdom, hoping that one day they will have a role." The one on the subordinate's body is the vestment given by the king, which can prove the identity of the subordinate. His subordinates have prepared the secret passage and ask His Royal Highness the Prince to set off immediately. ”

Whether the person who came is credible has become the biggest question now, but staying in the fierce Chiyan Country is definitely not a feasible way, it is better to believe him, and the ice-colored robes on his body are indeed very convincing.

Sen Yun also stared at the robe for a long time before turning his face to look at me, and we nodded to each other as if we had understood.

When the visitor saw our movements, he got up and walked into me and said, "Your Royal Highness, let me carry you." ”

Although the ice sun was about to set, he was close enough to see the wrinkles on his face in the weak light. I couldn't help but sigh in my heart, if we didn't appear, would he really be in the Chiyan Country - isn't this his homeland dying?

With the infinite sigh in my heart, I inadvertently closed my eyes, so suddenly the red fire surrounded my eyelids again, and this time it was not the girl who had appeared many times before, but an old man with a wrinkled face smiling kindly, feeling very familiar.

I hurriedly shook my head and opened my eyes, and the first glance fell on this wrinkled face, and suddenly I had a sudden realization, isn't that person just like him? Why live in that unknown red memory? My mind is full of questions.

When the people saw me shaking my head repeatedly, thinking that I still didn't trust him, they quickly explained, "Your Royal Highness, time is running out now, please trust your subordinates, even if they fight their lives, they will save His Royal Highness." ”

He carried me through palaces on his back, walking so fast that it really made me worry about Sen Yun who followed behind, but the people in the Yan Ice Realm have always had better physical strength than the Cold Ice Country and the Chiyan Country, and they have never followed me.

But it is also strange to feel that I, a person who has lost my memory, how can I remember the characteristics of the Yanbing World?

It was a long way to go, and finally he stopped at the edge of a pool, and he cast a spell to separate the water and freeze it into ice, and there he fixed it, and the bottom of the pool—the normal-looking stone floor—collapsed with one of his jumps, and we were in a secret passage. He cast a spell to seal the hole, and we continued on our way.

The secret passage was very quiet, except for the footsteps of the two people, even the sound of dripping water could be clearly heard. It was dark, like closing my eyes, but I knew that if I closed my eyes now, it would definitely not be the dark feeling in front of me.

It had been a while since I left the secret passage and galloped on the grassland, and I looked back more often at Sen Yun, who was a little weak, and he seemed to understand my intentions, and he also looked back, and said, "Let's rest on that small hill in front." ”

Senyun, who was already tired and about to fall, saw that he hurriedly came to help, but it was still too far away, and just when I was about to fall to the ground, the man helped me.

"What exactly was that water that day?" I looked at the endless prairie around me, the ice sun had set, and looked at the man who had already sat down and said.

"The water of memories is something left by the prince of Chiyan Kingdom before his death, it is said that he wants to use mana to put his life's memories in that water, and the prince of Chiyan Kingdom is also the person with the highest mana power in Chiyan Country, I think your current symptoms may be because his mana and your mana are comparable."

"He's dead?" I was a little puzzled, since he was the person with the strongest mana, how could he die so easily?

"Died at the bottom of Chiyan Lake, and his fiancée also died, why he died is not yet known. It's just that the king of Chiyan Country has been sad for a long time about this, and after recovering, he is like a changed person everywhere, but this is also a good thing, maybe he wants to fill the vacancy of his son. ”

Then there was another silence, each thinking about it.

It didn't take long for the man to stand up alertly and say, "Let's go quickly, the enemy has already chased us." ”

Saying that, he quickly ran with me on his back.

It didn't take long for the pursuers to be able to see the silhouette, and Sen Yun's physical strength became more and more obvious.

Knowing that it was obviously impossible to escape, the man let Senyun carry me on his back, and finally let a girl carry him, thinking about it, I really felt incompetent, but this is not the first time, I should have been carried by her not long after I woke up, but I didn't feel anything at that time. Her warm body temperature traveled to my skin through her tights, my spiritual melting robe, and the warm feeling directly entered my heart.

"You flee with the prince on your back, I'll stop them!" The man said excitedly, it seems that a big war is already impossible to avoid.

The chasing soldiers have stopped, because they are already within the distance that we can see their faces clearly, judging by their vestments, the chasing soldiers should be the king, the nine palace protectors, a number of princes and some military ministers, it is really a luxurious lineup, it is like welcoming the prince to the throne, which also indicates that this battle will be lost.

Sen Yun didn't know how to do it with me on his back, standing dumbfounded, but it was good to face off like this, and he could recover some physical strength for the time being.

"Nuan Haiwang, I should have realized that you are a spy, it seems that I was too careless." One of the enemy formations spoke and spoke to the man. Only then did I realize that I had stayed with that person for so long without asking anyone's name.

"Thanks to Your Majesty's care, today I have to return to China, my name is Binghaiwang, and there will be a period later." Although he said so, he did not mean to turn back and leave, because he also knew that the enemy was not coming at him, and he would definitely not leave like this.

"Whether you call Nuan Wanghai or Bing Wanghai, you can't leave today." With that, he prepared to step forward and attack.

But the world is so strange, the good luck of good people may not be just a coincidence, maybe the seeds of good luck were sown in the land a long time ago.

The ice-colored robes quickly appeared in the direction of our escape, and when I could see the face, I was completely stunned, weren't those the people I woke up to see for the first time? It was Senyun who rescued me from them, why did they need me so much that they found the secret underwater palace, and even now found here.

Seeing such a huge ice-colored team, Binghai Wang thanked God loudly, "Great, finally saved, even the eldest prince came." ”

Hearing Binghaiwang's words, Sen Yun shouted loudly, "No, he has betrayed the kingdom, he is coming to capture Brother Binghe!" ”

When Binghai Wang heard this, he looked pale and stood there dumbfounded, probably thinking about which side he should believe, on one side was the second prince of the Cold Ice Country that he was saving, and on the other side was the eldest prince.

Bing Haiwang was still standing there dumbfounded, with various assumptions constantly churning in his heart. Sen Yun walked over and asked him, "There is no way anymore, can I borrow your mana?" ”

Bing Haiwang was already a little overwhelmed, and although his identity as a spy made him unfazed many times, it was difficult for him not to be surprised by such an outrageous thing. Mu Ranyhong also nodded weakly.

Without reliance, I just lay on the ground, and Sen Yun shouted to Bing Wanghai: "Take me as the center, cast the teleportation array, please help!" ”

While helping, Bing Haiwang asked, "Will you teleport instantly?" ...... What is the first layer? ”

"The first floor... Please be sure to protect him and help him recover his memory. ”

Bing Haiwang knew that the teleportation of the first layer meant that the teleportation caster would not teleport away, and this was extremely mana-consuming magic, and if you barely used it, you would only lose your life, and it was used in front of the enemy, it was obvious that it could only be arbitrarily slaughtered by the enemy after completion. And this kind of teleportation is not a real sense of teleportation at all, it will actually only eject the people in the formation, just like throwing stones, thrown to a designated place, but if there are two stones, it will definitely not fall to the same position.

"I told you to go to the 'sacred place', where they did not dare to approach." After Sen Yun said this, he turned to me and said, "You won't change, I won't change, so we'll still meet." ”

I saw tears running down his face, dripping on my heart one by one, cutting my heart like a blade, and I didn't have the strength to speak out now, although I tried my best, but the sound was still too small, because the noise of this magic array was too loud to even hear the sound of enemies attacking from both sides.

When I was ejected by the powerful force, in the last scene, I saw her fall to the ground, her beautiful face still clearly visible, tears had been swept into the air by the wind inside, crystal clear, like strands of scattered pearls—never perfect.
