```
I just want to love you all the time
 Wherever you go, even if you're leaving, I'll always be with you in your dreams

My tears of sadness had broken down my cheeks, and today we broke up
 I am the dream of the past that you have abandoned, and there are new dreams tomorrow

Your vows to me, which I have always remembered, were cut by your own hands
 I stood helplessly in the wind and wept without that solid reliance
 The hands and feet are numb, and the heart is tired and beating

I just want to be with you all the time
 No matter what happens to you, even if you can't walk, I'll always be there for you
 I just want to love you all the time
 Wherever you go, even if you're leaving, I'll always be with you in your dreams
 Record our journey of love with an infinitely long scroll, so that our joy will never deteriorate

Remember the eternal vows made by your gentle and sweet lips
 Remember your words from the heart that nourished my tears
 The necklace of a lifetime of love connects our hearts and shakes in our time
 My happy times have been dispersed, and I can't find my inner paradise
 Struggling but not catching up, your heart has gone far away

Snuggled up in your arms and not felt
 Hold close to your heart, no matter how hard I try, I can't catch up with you
 It's the same in words, but only hurt
 Close to your lips, no matter how hard I try, I can't keep your tenderness
 Unfold the picture of the past, remember the first sweetness, and it makes my face full of tears

I just want to be with you all the time
 No matter what happens to you, even if you can't walk, I'll always be there for you
 I just want to love you all the time
 Wherever you go, even if you're leaving, I'll always be with you in your dreams
 Record our journey of love with an infinitely long scroll, so that our joy will never deteriorate

I will always love you and follow behind you
 There will come a day when your heart will understand that I watch over you and wait for that day
