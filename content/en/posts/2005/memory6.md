If I still have a memory, I will feel the passage of time, just like I am flying now.

The air whistled by, wiping my face with a tingling sensation. Bing Haiwang had long been separated from me during the flight, but the sadness of watching him get farther and farther away from me kept stimulating my heart, as if the distant déjà vu scene resurfaced.

I crossed the green area called the sacred forest, and the lake set like a jewel in the middle of this sacred forest came into my sight, and I guessed, guessing that I would definitely fall straight into the water, and while I was still wondering if I could climb out of the lake, I fell squarely into the water.

In the gentle and warm water, I temporarily forgot the troubles in my heart, and completely floated in the water to enjoy the infinite tenderness. As time passed in the water, I did not feel a trace of physical exhaustion, but felt more powerful, and seemed to return to my previous state, and I thought to myself, maybe this is the legendary divine spring, which can purify all sacred water.

In the confusion, I opened my eyes, but what I saw was under the blue water, nine people—or should I say nine corpses, standing in the shape of a magic array, except for them motionless, maybe I really thought that they were still alive people, the legal formation should have been ten people, but I don't know what happened to them so that they could only have nine people, and the lack of the most central position.

I'm still thinking aimlessly about the scenes in front of me. But suddenly I felt that someone seemed to be calling my name, and when I turned my head slightly, I vaguely saw a handsome young man, a red flame surrounded him, and with the ripples of the water, he in front of me twisted a little, perhaps relying on the power of this divine water to make a soul like him appear in front of my eyes in a real form.

"We meet again," the soul in the water began to speak, "although we have been together for a long time, but it is really interesting that we can meet in this way on such a special occasion!" You have completely lost your memory, it is no longer meaningful to you whether you exist in this world, and I still have many grievances that I have not dealt with, so I need a complete body more than you, let such a good body be left for a soul without memory, such a waste is better to leave this body to those who need him, so let me take over this body! ”

"I have no memory, my existence has no meaning to the world" My heart unconsciously began to repeat these words over and over again, my soul seemed to fly away from my body unconsciously, I can now see myself from another person's perspective, but all I can see is my own body, and the most important thing in man, the soul, is indeed something that no one can look at from another angle.

Slowly his soul melted into the body that was originally mine, and I was on the side slowly watching it happen. The mouth constantly muttered "I have no memory, my existence has no meaning to the world".

After the fusion was completed, he had already begun to use this body to walk towards the surface with difficulty.

Slowly, I became looking at him from afar. The water still flowed so gently, gently making a small swirl on my face, as if I remembered something, yes, she dripped tears on my face for me, so softly.

Suddenly, I felt a little reluctant to my body, and I still had to use this body to find my lost memories, "Wait a minute, I also have to do things, I want my body." ”

"It's too late, when your body leaves the surface with my soul, you can only stay under this water until one day you become an elf." Saying that, he was still carrying my body towards the water.

I was also a little anxious, so I eagerly pounced on my body, probably he didn't expect that without the drag of the body, the soul movement speed is extremely fast, in an instant I appeared in my own body and squeezed with him, after all, it is my own body, maybe there is a better affinity, soon I have the upper hand, but there is no way to force his soul out of my body, his soul has been curled up in my left arm, the hammer of the teeth and claws is everywhere in my body, and I can't stand steadily. But I didn't find that the direction of my shaking was exactly the direction of the water, and unconsciously, the range of the shaking of the hand could already extend out of the water, but we were all still struggling to force each other out of our bodies, which may be the real life and death struggle, the fight for their lives, no party will admit defeat, both hands are dancing from time to time to the surface.

I could feel that my energy had been released too much, but he was not too close, still entrenched in my left arm.

I couldn't feel the passage of time anymore, so I struggled with willpower until I really lost my consciousness.

When I woke up, I was already sleeping in a warm bed, I felt that my energy had returned to a good level, jumped up and sat on the edge of the bed, looked at this simple and broken hut, looked around, simple is indeed simple, but dressed very warmly, it seems that this house must be a hostess. The flowers in the vase on the table were bright and dazzling, and I couldn't help but find that this fresh and fragrant fragrance came from here, and I smiled in my heart, thinking that maybe this hostess was still a little girl who loved flowers.

After fixing my mind, I raised my left hand, took a look, tried to move my fingers, no problem, my body still belongs to me, but suddenly there is a trace of sadness, he may disappear in this world like this, in fact, I killed him again, and for it is indeed my own survival, I can't help but feel some heartache.

In such a small room, people have to feel a lot of depressed feelings, so they thought about going out to take a look, but suddenly found a person sitting on the chair at the door, presumably it should be the owner of this room, from the back, gray hair, seems to be an old grandmother. I slowly walked to her side, saw her sleeping with her eyes closed, I slowly adjusted the angle, until I could see her face squarely, I found that the way she slept could not be described by the usual description of the serenity of the old man, but should be described by describing the beauty of the girl, which I myself also felt very contradictory, the wrinkled face and gray-haired old man I actually used the words to describe the girl to describe her.

I continued to look at her, her body was not at all like the slight blessing of an ordinary old man but very thin, as if a gust of wind could blow her up like a leaf. At his feet were some flowers, the color was very different from that around the hut, and it seemed that they had been picked from other places.

Many of the surrounding trees are also very tall, but it is very suitable to let the sun shine in and shine on the body, which is very comfortable.

"Are you awake?" A gentle girlish voice came from beside her. This voice also made me more convinced of my feeling just now, this "grandmother" is not as old as he seems, maybe it is a little girl.

"Hmm," I replied as I looked back at her, her eyes still closed, and I continued, "Thank you for your hospitality, this is not far from the lake, right?" ”

"Yes, yesterday when I was passing by picking flowers, I saw you fall on the grass by the lake."

"Oh, thank you for your help in dragging me here so heavy."

"It's okay, I can't leave you there alone, whoever changes will do it."

Thank you, I didn't say it this time, but I sincerely thank you in my heart. We were silent, and I looked at her, but she still had her eyes closed, but she still had a smile on her face, as if she was looking at me.

"Actually, there's a question I want to ask, but I don't know if I should ask it or not."

"Ask, I'll try to answer." She still turned her face at me with her eyes closed and a smile.

"Actually, I was trying to ask... Why don't you open your eyes? ”

"Because I don't have eyes."

"Huh? No..." The somewhat unexpected answer made my language a little flustered, and quickly apologized, "I'm sorry." ”

"Nothing, already used to it."

"Do people come here often?" I continued to ask my doubts.

"Besides my sister, you're the first person I've seen here."

"See? Can you see me? "The doubts seem to grow stronger as the problem deepens.

"Yes, now I don't need to rely on my eyes to see things, I don't know what it is, but it's just a feeling." I slowly thought about what she had just said, and I couldn't help but fall silent again.

"Are you familiar with me?" To break the silence, I asked this question, which I found strange myself.

"Unfamiliar."

"Then it seems that you have no problem with me." Rather, a strange stranger like me didn't even ask a question.

"If I want to say it, I will listen to it, but I am here just waiting for the day when it disappears, and when it disappears, my memory will also pass."

"But in fact, I don't know who I am, I woke up with lost my memory, there were many people around me who paid attention to me, some really cared about me, and some just wanted to use me, although I guessed that my original memory must contain a lot of pain, but I will still try to get back this thing that belongs to it, because there will be responsibilities that I need to complete in this world."

"Alas, responsibility is a harmful thing." As I spoke, the smile on her face slowly faded into a pensive look.

"In any case, if you say your own responsibility, you must bear it yourself, even if you let yourself live in pain, you can't put the responsibility on the head of others." Hearing my words, she suddenly laughed again.

"May God bless you with your strength to bear your responsibilities." She clasped her hands together and looked very reverent.

"Thank you."

"So, you have no memory, how are you going to find your memory?" She finally posed her first question, perhaps influenced by the previous conversation.

"I have a friend who seems to know everything about me, and I'm going to find her." After saying this, I suddenly remembered that Sen Yun threw me and Bing Haiwang out with teleportation, but he stayed in the enemy position, presumably he must have been taken away by the enemy.

"In the direction of the rising sun, you can get out of the forest."

"Thank you for your rescue and hospitality, but I hope to find my friend sooner, so I want to say goodbye now and see you later." Although he felt a little in a hurry, when he thought that Senyun was still in the hands of the enemy, he felt that he had to hurry.

"Wait a minute," she stopped me just as I was about to leave, "can I help?" ”

"Okay, you can," a little unexpectedly, she didn't even ask questions at first, and she would let me help.

She took out a letter in her pocket and said, "Go out of the first village in the forest and give this letter to the witch of that village." ”

I put the letter away and was about to leave, but she stopped me again, "It takes a long time to get out of the forest, you can go to the lake to fetch some water, that water is very nutritious and is an important source of food for the forest creatures." In exchange, Spirit Lake will also suck some nutrients out of you. ”

"Okay." I accepted her suggestion, went to the lake to fetch some water, came back and said goodbye to her again, and walked in the direction of the rising sun, and with my brisk footsteps, the cottage and the magical grandmother gradually disappeared into the depths of the woods.
