    - leaving investments in the digital assets space vulnerable to fraud, manipulation, and abuse.
    - Some cryptocurrency market exchanges and stablecoin issuers
        - have obtained state money transmitter and sale of checks licenses from multiple states, 
        - and a few cryptocurrency companies have obtained national charters
- Stablecoin-related policy concerns include issues related to
    - market integrity,
    - investor protection,
    - consumer protection,
    - financial stability,
    - monetary policy,
    - payments,
    - and illicit activity prevention.
- risk
    - potential systemic risk posed by stablecoins
    - losses or instability of stablecoins could generate instability throughout the financial system.
    - potential fraud and manipulation
    - and the need for disclosure and transparency.
        - For example, investigations by the New York State Office of the Attorney General revealed that stablecoins issued by Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, were not fully backed at all times, raising investor-protection concerns.

    - access to jurisdictions with weak regimes allowing for money laundering,
    - and the pseudonymity provided by certain cryptocurrencies.
    - ransomware attacks
        - The lack of safeguards in parts of the market has contributed to the rise in ransomware attacks that demand payment in cryptocurrency
        - with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network noting that $590 million in suspected ransomware payments were reported by financial institutions in the first six months of 2021, compared to $416 million in 2020.
    - While the overall criminal share of cryptocurrency activity is estimated to be a small portion of the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market, given the size of that market, the harm of the illicit funds can be impactful.
- Cryptocurrency users may also be vulnerable
    - theft
    - fraud
    - hacks.
- environmental concerns.
    - crypto mining – the process of validating certain transactions
