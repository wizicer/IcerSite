I continued to paddle this year, didn't play very well (and barely prepared), barely squeezed into the top 30 (60 out of 60), but this year the competitors were really good, and I felt that I couldn't get into the top 10 no matter how good I played. Give them a thumbs up.
My impression is: I'm really fat [cover my face]

PS: Watching the news later, I barely squeezed into the top 50 in Shanghai
