After I took over the Association, I made some additions and repairs to the regulations, mainly as follows:
------------------------------------------------------

1. The term of office of the president of the association is changed from sophomore to junior. By the end of their sophomore year, the student's experience has basically matured, and he already has the ability and consciousness to assume the position of president of the association. In the junior year, there may be a lot of graduation-related things entangled, so that the affairs of the association cannot be carried out smoothly and orderly, so this change is made.

2. Sponsorship and successfully hold activities, and 10% of the benefits go to the sponsored students. This is to encourage more students to bring better sponsorship, so that the association can develop in an orderly and healthy manner.

3. All students who give lectures will receive a remuneration of 30 yuan. In this way, students are encouraged to give more lectures and lectures, on the one hand, it can enrich the activities of the association, on the other hand, the lecturer can get the training of technology, eloquence, appearance and other aspects.
