## Some notes about Dollar Computer Repair:

1. As the largest computer club of Chongqing Jiaotong University, the Computer Association shoulders the task of popularizing computer knowledge and improving the computer level of students.
2. For simple computer software problems, the personnel of our alliance can reply by phone.
3. For slightly complex and peculiar problems, on-site maintenance can be adopted.
4. This maintenance activity is an obligatory act, and one yuan is only used as a simple subsidy for communication expenses and road expenses.

## Recruitment of maintenance personnel

Request:

1. Hard-working, self-motivated.
2. Have good communication skills and good interpersonal relationships.

Working hours: After-school time, which will never affect learning.

Note: Even if you do not have any maintenance experience, as long as you have enthusiasm, after our regular professional maintenance knowledge training, I believe that your own computer knowledge and maintenance ability will be greatly improved, which will be a lot of wealth for your life.
