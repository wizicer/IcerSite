1. Purpose of the Plan
====================

Executing the plan has three benefits:

* When students encounter simple computer problems, they do not need to wait for the computer company to solve them, or take the computer to the computer company for repair without purpose
* Gain more hands-on opportunities for participants in the program and gradually gain experience in repairing computers
* This program can also make computer literacy more widely available

2. Feasibility of the plan
========================

The designation of this program is based on the current situation of the association:

* The Association for Computing Machinery is already a large association of more than 200 people, spread in every corner of the school
* Students who enter the association all want to come to learn knowledge, which just provides a platform

After implementing this plan, we can expect the following impacts:

* Increase the visibility of the Association for Computing Machinery
* Computer literacy has been popularized
* The maintenance level of the students participating in the program has been improved

In summary, it can be seen that the plan has good practical significance and is worth implementing.

3. Implementation plan
====================

* Step 1: Meet to inform the plan and elect the person in charge.
* Step 2: Gather officers and members of the Association for Computing Machinery to attract people to the program.
* Step 3: Assign tasks and conduct training mobilization meetings.
* Step 4: Publicity, posters, God bless publicity.
* Step 5: Welcome new students and attract new members.
* Step 6: Ongoing and regular training activities.

4. Organization of personnel
====================

The personnel are arranged according to the following pyramid pattern:

* General Manager: The person with the strongest maintenance and technical ability is in charge. Suitable for 1-2 people.
* District Leader: A person who already has more maintenance experience and is capable of carrying out most of the independent maintenance ability, and the personnel should cover the four communities within the school. Suitable for 4-6 people.
* Maintenance personnel: Personnel who have some maintenance experience, but are not competent enough to serve as the head of the division. The number of people is not limited.
* Maintenance staff assistant: by students who want to learn maintenance and have little maintenance experience. The number of people is not limited.

Because the person in charge has strong ability, there are more stories, and in order to make maintenance personnel and maintenance personnel assistants get more learning opportunities, only the contact information of maintenance personnel and maintenance personnel assistants is written on the publicity materials.

5. Timeline
====================

The general plan is as follows:

* Second week of September: First personnel organization.
* Third week of September Wednesday: First repair training.
* Week 3 to 4 of September: Publicity of the $1 maintenance campaign.
* Second week of October: A maintenance seminar for new students.
* 2nd week of November: 3rd maintenance training and seminar.
* 2nd week of December: Last maintenance training and seminar of the semester.

The specific time will be changed and arranged according to the specific situation at that time.
