In light of the recent [XCH theft] (https://chiaforum.com/t/attention-coins-disappear-from-wallets/18854/129), many friends are very concerned about how to keep their assets safe. Here, I would like to recommend you to create an Air-gap (offline) wallet using a mint wallet.

### What is an Air-gapped?

[Air Gap Wallet] (https://supraoracles.com/academy/what-is-an-air-gapped-wallet/) are crypto wallets that are completely disconnected from the internet and any form of physical wireless communication, which can effectively enhance security.

[Mint Wallet] (https://info.pawket.app/) is the first air-gapped wallet in the Chia ecosystem. With Mint Wallet, you can create an offline and secure air-gapped wallet. You can also use it to sign transactions offline (with an online device) and enjoy the same convenience as an online wallet.

**This tutorial will teach you how to create an air-gapped wallet and initiate offline transactions. **

### How to create an air gapped wallet using Mint wallet

- Reset an Android phone and set WiFi/Bluetooth/GPS to disabled.

- Using USB, upload the [pawket.apk] (https://github.com/SutuLabs/pawket-android/tags) file to your phone and install it. (No internet connection required)

- Follow the prompts to complete the wallet creation. This is an Air-gappde wallet created completely offline. (hereinafter referred to as AGP).

### How to initiate a transaction using an air-gapped wallet

- After creating an account with AGP, share the account public key* with your online mint wallet (hereinafter referred to as ONP).

* *: Get the public key of the account, click "Scan" → "Public Key QR Code" on the login screen.

- After adding the AGP's public key to the ONP, you can view the balance, using almost all online functions such as "send XCH/CAT, create/accept offers, send in bulk, issue CAT, issue NFT", etc.

- However, since only the public key is added to ONP, only the observer wallet can be viewed.
