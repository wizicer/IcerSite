## Introduction to the event

Chia blockchain was founded by BT founder Bram Cohen with the vision of building a green energy-saving and secure and compliant blockchain network, so the Chia blockchain was different from the beginning, using PoST's consensus method to solve the energy consumption problem of PoW without being too centralized like PoS. Chia has also never conducted an ICO to comply with regulation. At present, Chia has more than 100,000 nodes around the world, making it the most decentralized public chain project.

As a smart contract language on the Chia blockchain, Chialisp has advantages over other languages in terms of security and efficiency, but also because it belongs to the category of functional programming languages, it often has a high learning threshold for beginners.

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the launch of the Chia mainnet, we launched the Chia Meetup & Chialisp Workshop to introduce Chia's latest roadmap and on-chain applications, Chialisp programming language and corresponding developer tools to inspire developers' ideas, strengthen interactive communication, and collide with creative sparks.
