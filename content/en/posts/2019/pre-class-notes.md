Today, when I was browsing my mentor's circle of friends, I felt a sense of empowerment.

Before, I always thought that I had good note-taking habits, such as taking notes during class, supplementing notes after class, and organizing notes after a stage. However, today I realized that I had neglected the important part of pre-study notes.

I used to think that the preview was enough to make some marks on the book, outline the main points that I didn't understand, and then go to the lecture with questions. However, I now realize that only by taking preview notes can we really effectively understand the course structure and thus better absorb and understand the knowledge. This method is worth our in-depth study and practice.

When I looked back at my notes, I realized that they weren't as good as I thought. This prompted me that I needed to revisit and improve my note-taking method, especially in the prep phase. Preview notes not only help me better understand and absorb the course content, but also improve my learning efficiency.
