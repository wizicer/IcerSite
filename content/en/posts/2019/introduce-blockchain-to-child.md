This afternoon, I shared my knowledge of blockchain with a group of children in the Siping Road community. Through the game, we explored the world of blockchain together.
Among them, the children's favorite games are "proof of work" and "digital signature", and the scene was very lively for a while. Their imagination is amazing and they can pick up on any topic.

In the game "Digital Signature", we had a practical exercise.

In the "Proof of Work" game, we invited groups of children to play miners and simulate the workload by throwing colors. Every time 6 points are thrown, a block can be added, and eventually, blocks of different teams (colors) form a complete blockchain.

We also have a special blockchain architecture design sticker for children. This sticker game is designed to help children understand the elements of a blockchain project in a fun way. Through this game, they can intuitively understand what key considerations need to be covered in a complete blockchain project.

When asked, "What is blockchain?" They explained in their own language: "It's just blocks one by one, linked down." This explanation is simple and straightforward, which is easy for children to understand.

Through this activity, the children not only understood the basic concept of blockchain, but also experienced the operation process of blockchain through hands-on participation.

I believe that it will be a very meaningful learning experience for children.
