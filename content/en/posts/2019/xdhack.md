Participated in the xdHack event on the weekend, made a video summary rapid extraction system, or the traditional picture pattern recognition algorithm (now seems to be collectively called artificial intelligence) is done.
It was an honor to receive the second prize.

The idea for this smart video digest system stemmed from the problems we encountered in organizing our blockchain technology data. We found that there were tons of technical videos to watch and understand, which consumed a lot of our time. Therefore, we wanted to develop a tool that could quickly convert video into graphics so that we could quickly understand and grasp the content in the video.

After discussion, our team decided that this tool is also very suitable for new media editors, so we positioned it as a tool that can quickly convert video into pictures/text/GIFs/small videos in real time to adapt to the communication needs of different platforms.

The idea popped up two days before the competition and we quickly made a decision and started developing. On the day of the race, my teammates even brought a tripod and camera and recorded a video of the scene as a sample for our experiment. I initially just wanted to develop a tool that I could use myself, but the system was well received and we won the second prize.

This experience made me realize that we need to listen more to people's needs so that we can develop tools that are more relevant to their needs. I look forward to continuing to develop more useful tools to meet your needs in the days ahead.

**Circle of Friends Review:**

- Friend: If you start a business with this project, you may be more successful than blockchain
- Friend: We posted a video summary paper this year, using GAN
- Liang Shuang: Why are you all persuading me to return to the field of image recognition, what about my belief in blockchain?
- Friend: Tovac and Git seem to have such a plot
- Friend: Shuangba inadvertently came up with a good demand-oriented product
- Friends: Break down an image into seven or eight pieces to become a blockchain
- Friend: Blockchain is a tool for practical applications that may sometimes be more valuable
