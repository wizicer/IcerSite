Today, I have the honor to participate in the preliminary round of the 7th Shanghai Science Popularization Interpretation Competition in Yangpu District. In this competition, I explained the secrets of blockchain to everyone, hoping to make this revolutionary technology understandable and accessible to more people.

I am very honored to be in the top 10 and awarded the title of "Yangpu District Excellent Science Popularization Ambassador". All these achievements are inseparable from the support and encouragement of teachers and friends, and I would like to express my deep gratitude.

In the competition, I did my best to explain how blockchain works and applications, hoping to help more people understand this technology and see its future possibilities.
