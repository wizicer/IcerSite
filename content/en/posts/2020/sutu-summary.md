We moved into Tongji Science Park at the end of 2019 and rented a workplace. By March of this year, we had moved from a workstation area to a separate office.

This is the result of our careful selection in recruitment campaigns since the beginning of the year. We communicated with more than 700 people through the network, interviewed more than 100 people by phone, and finally selected a group of small partners with excellent skills and characteristics to join our team. I am very grateful for their trust and support.

Today, Sutu Technology was interviewed by Oriental Satellite TV, and we talked about the prospects of blockchain applications. During the interview, the reporter expressed great interest in our product in the testing stage - Sutu.com, and learned more about the blockchain technology and transaction methods we apply.

The founder of Sutu Technology clearly stated in the interview: "We use blockchain technology to achieve the copyright deposit of pictures, including the storage of transaction records. ”

Sutu.com is a decentralized, open and transparent image copyright trading market based on blockchain technology. Here, creatives can display original images, share creative content, and trade image copyrights to meet the diverse original image needs of customers. All picture information, transaction records and authorization records will be synchronized on the chain to achieve relevant information traceability, so as to protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties.

The advantage of Sutu.com is that the platform does not save the original picture, and the peer-to-peer transaction between buyers and creators, the transaction record is completely open and transparent, and cannot be tampered with or forged.

Sutu.com mainly solves the following problems:

1. The problem of the reduction of creators' rights and interests: Sutu.com does not need creators to provide original images, buyers directly initiate transactions with creators, and the platform has never been able to obtain original images.

2. The problem of high cost of customer image purchase: Sutu.com separates from third-party providers to complete transactions and realize peer-to-peer transactions.

3. There is a problem of black box operation in the centralized market: the sales records of Sutu.com are open and transparent, and the most real sales records can be fully known.

4. Difficult problem of copyright maintenance: The blockchain technology used by Sutu.com has the characteristics of decentralization, traceability, tamper-proof, anti-counterfeiting, etc., which can fully guarantee the authenticity and reliability of data, thereby protecting the copyright of creators.

Our vision is to become the "Taobao" of electronic data products! We believe that the application of blockchain technology is expected to transform the entire digital copyright market, promote resource sharing, optimize the transaction authorization process, reduce platform operating costs, and build a trusted copyright system.
