```
I crossed mountains full of greenery
 I drifted through the white and immaculate clouds
 I walked through layers of deep blue sea
 I brushed through the bloody battlefields

I kept calling out your name
 Begging for your response
 I'm constantly looking for you
 Praying for your news

The breeze leaked through my fingers, reminding me of your delicate hands
 He once led me and said, "Peace will come."
 The sunlight crosses your face, reminding me of your smiling face
 Zeng pouted and said: "You have to protect your sister well"

However, when the smoke of gunfire filled here
 When the muzzle of the gun is pointed at me and glows
 As you slide down my body to the ground
 All vows turned into beautiful clouds in the sky that were about to dissipate

You said you would grow a pair of wings
 Fly over the abyss of sin
 Fly to the land of peace
 Fly into endless joy

Sister, I came with you
 When the fragments of the bomb passed through my body and stained the blood of the executioner
 I grew snow-white wings of happiness
 I can come to my sister

But, sister, you're walking too fast
 I lost your message
 Can you hear your brother?
 Where are you, sister?
```
