## A first look at new RPGs

The so-called new RPG, that is to say, to make the RPG game not modified can also make players shout enjoyment, throughout the current RPG games, are similar to "leveling - maze - big boss" unified route, in order to defeat the "not human" big boss, players have to level up crazy, or it is convenient to change it. This not only goes against the original intention of the creators, but also makes the most prominent plot of the RPG game less important, and also consumes a lot of the player's time on boring things, which is undeserved. In that case, how can you make the new RPG more vibrant? I believe that players and gamers can have a lot of solutions at their fingertips - smarter AI that makes sense, huge and complete maps, you can use terrain characteristics to deal with enemies, don't encounter invincible enemies... These ideas are really good, but those who have worked in game production must know how difficult it is to complete this magnificent work, but we must not stop in spite of the difficulties.
