## Glacier Rhapsody

Finally, Game Ideas and Production is here!

Here, I will first introduce the layout of this journal:

Since it is called "Game Thinking and Production", we will definitely introduce you to innovative ideas about games and innovative ways of making games.

Of course, during the initial establishment of this journal, it may not be possible to produce fine products, but I believe that in the near future, we will definitely have a large number of excellent works emerge!

In addition, the development of this journal can not be without your participation. We welcome more people who are willing to commit to the game business to join us, if you have a good manuscript, please let the readers of "Game Thought and Production" share it with you!

We welcome any relevant contributions and promise to come back! Now, we eagerly await the following related contributions:

1. If you're a veteran, you can talk about your experience in game making.
2. If you're a layman in the gaming world, you can write what you want the game to look like.
3. If you're a game expert, you can write about the new features you want to see in your game.
4. DirectX is related to OpenGL programming, AI algorithms, etc
5. Game engine development and introduction
6. Animation production, art experience skills
7. Music, MIDI, sound effects and other related articles

## Discussion about game cheating

Recently, I saw that Sina.com and Popular Software engaged in a vigorous discussion of "whether the game should cheat", in fact, whether it should be cheated is very related to our programmers, they discuss "whether the game should cheat", we discuss "whether to design anti-modification"

Everyone is welcome to discuss!

## Closing remarks of the first issue

Finally, the production of the first issue was completed, and I was tired enough, so I quickly saved the article, and was just about to shout into the microphone "Shut down - the glacier is called by his father!" "I suddenly found that after the first issue, I should still write what I thought, so I will talk about it.

I found that a person's strength is really very limited, and it is really difficult to do something. I also found that online cooperation is also difficult, but it is even more difficult to have like-minded people around me, so I still choose online cooperation. Alas! When the Internet no longer requires money, the real Internet era will come, but that is ultimately an unrealistic fantasy, alas! Pity......

I am a typical idealist, and although I do not believe in the existence of ghosts and gods, I believe that any person can change the world through his will. Therefore, we are committed to game programmers, who should use games to change the world, not to simulate the real world.

So much for my nonsense, it's time to "rest in peace". One last thing I want to say is that I hate ads that are annoying, so you won't find ads on my Page or on my newsletter. This is enough to prove that I am not paid to produce the newsletter, just out of my interest. I hope you can encourage me to do a good job in this electronic newspaper, and I hope that you can tell your friends about this report, and strongly hope that you can send your article to this newspaper, so that the readers of this newspaper can share your results.

"Shut down—Glacier daddy!"
