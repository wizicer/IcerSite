...... I struggled to open my eyes slightly, felt a pinprick-like pain in my head, and then lost sensation again...

When I regained consciousness, my head and body were no longer so painful, so I tried to open my eyes, but I couldn't, a strange feeling arose, and after a while, I fell asleep again in a dizzy way...

After falling asleep, I had a strange dream, in which I swam in the blue ocean, stretching out my hands and kicking from time to time, as if I was going to fight something, I kept swimming like this, the scenery did not change at all, I looked around casually, as if I wanted to look for something, but what would it be? Suddenly, a loud thunder brought me back from sleep, only to feel my head regain consciousness, feel a numb feeling of being touched by electricity, and slowly, my whole body began to ache until I passed out again.

The eyes finally broke away, the first thing I saw was the crystal clear ceiling, the sea-blue ceiling had an indescribable good-looking, then I found that there was a person next to me, just about to turn around and see, the arm was a little harder, and again felt a tingling sensation in the whole body, and I couldn't help but cry out "ah", at this time, the person's face entered my field of vision, it was a very kind face, but it was a little more haggard, he seemed to be saying something in his mouth, but he couldn't understand what she wanted to express, I had no other way but to look at her in a daze. Slowly, more and more faces came into my field of vision, looking at me with strange eyes, saying something to me, but I couldn't understand it at all. Suddenly, I felt as if there was a drop of water on my face, itching strangely uncomfortable, so I tried to wipe it off, but I moved slightly, I felt severe pain all over my body, so it was another "ah", helplessly closed my eyes, gradually, the sound went away, so I tentatively broke open my eyes, and found that there was a pair of eyes looking at me surprisingly, but did not speak, white eyes, Lanlan's hair, almost white face, but with a slight warmth, in my heart, she is simply a fairy, there is nothing more perfect than it, just like that, I looked at her, she looked at me, and slowly, I went to sleep.

I was here without any worries, and after a while, many days passed, and she was always by my side at every moment, not half a step away from me, like my shadow.

At noon that day, I was looking up at the sky through the almost transparent ceiling, and the Lanlan sun shone on my body, making my whole body feel very comfortable. At this time, a group of people walked in, one of them was a tall man, closest to me, seemed to be saying something to me, I still could only stare at him, they couldn't help but look at each other awkwardly and smile, so the man wanted to step forward and pull me up from the bed, I didn't know what to do, only to cast a help-saving gaze to her standing on the side, somehow, she screamed strangely, her face was very ugly, but she came forward to help me out of bed, since it was her, I also got out of bed by the way, and I always felt an indescribable sense of intimacy with her these days, We do things very well. She led me to a strange place, far less beautiful than the one I had recuperated, though it was also a room with a transparent ceiling. All of them looked at me, she pulled me to a chair and motioned for me to sit down, and when I sat down, I felt as if my whole body was bound by a rope, and suddenly I felt a drop of water dripping on my handboard, I didn't know what it was, I just felt that it was like something, something that seemed to be very precious.

Many of them were scattered all over the room, some standing, some sitting in front of the testers, and I could only strangely watch, and when I noticed that she was not with me, she seemed to have left the room, and I said silently, "Where are you going, are you not here with me?" ”

When I came back to my senses, nine of their mages had already surrounded me in a defensive formation, as if they were about to unleash magic, but I saw the tall man from before shouted a few times, so the mages were lucky enough to cast a spell, and three rays of light invaded my body, protecting my deadly organs, as if someone was going against me. During this time, I have been like a newborn, unfamiliar with the world around me, and I can't understand the language of these people, except that she seems to be able to communicate with my heart, I don't know anything else, so I can't do anything else except silence, but their defensive array seems to hook my brain nerves again, and I involuntarily use defensive magic, those people first looked at me strangely, and then the tall man seemed to say something, and the nine mages immediately changed the formation, changed to the attack formation, and the attack is me as the formation master, I have no way, only to use the maximum mana to try to support the defensive array, but after all, the mana of those people is too strong, I can't fight at all, suddenly I feel that my brain is touched by electricity, can't bear it, so I cried out, this voice may not be understood by others, but I know that this is the only language I can understand to save me. At this moment, I heard a very special loud noise, as if the room had been exploded, but my brain no longer felt it, so I fainted...

When I woke up, I seemed to go back to the room, but after a short thought, I was quite sure that I was not in the previous room now, but the furnishings here were very similar to there, looking through the ceiling, I couldn't see Lanlan's sun, but it didn't seem to be a blue sky, it fluctuated softly, deep and bright, it seemed that this was the bottom of the sea, I was surprised and couldn't believe it, I couldn't help but ask myself in my heart, but I asked out loud, in the previous language that I didn't know what it was, "The bottom of the sea?" ”

"You're finally awake? Great, yes, this is the deepest and safest palace in the world that you personally built. Her face quickly came into my field of vision, and I could see that she was a little excited, but also seemed a little sad embedded in her snow-white pupils.

I couldn't help but be surprised, not only because I understood someone else's words for the first time, but she seemed to understand what I said. Her answer surprised me even more, was this really built by me? How could I not be impressed? I can remember the names and uses of so many things, as well as the uses and formations of those magic, but I don't remember this splendid palace built by my own hands, is this possible? At this time, many questions flashed through my mind, and for me, there were too many questions that needed to be answered.

She seemed to see what was on my mind, sat down on the edge of my bed, and said slowly: "Brother Glacier, you have forgotten the past, and you will never remember..." "I'm obviously a little excited, am I going to lose my past because of this? I just wanted to continue asking, but I felt a dripping water running across the back of my hand, just like last time, I had a very strange feeling, but I couldn't think of it, I saw that she was about to speak, so I didn't interrupt, so I had to listen carefully

"You have only returned from another world..."

"Another world?" I asked in surprise and curiosity.

"Yes, but no one but you knows where the other world is, how to get there, what's there. Don't interrupt me yet, listen to me."

"Hmm," I nodded in agreement.

"One day, when you finished a study, you went to report to the king, but the king said that there was a crisis in the frontier, made you a general, and gave you a small army, and when you rushed to the so-called scene of the incident, there was not the slightest sign of war. But then a large number of people arrived, this group of people is not simple, there are your brother, the nine protectors, and a few elite troops, this is obviously not a simple battle, because in any case, there is no reason to send the nine protectors together. In the end, it turned out that everything happened, they rebelled, and almost killed you, but somehow, they finally wanted to save your life, as if your life seemed to be a little important to them, so I tried to save you, but they found out, I was controlled by your brother's mind technique, no freedom, no way, but finally you spoke and gave me an order, so the heart-eating technique that your brother cast on me lost its effect, so I rushed in, cooperated with your mana, and repelled them, I immediately fled here, but you didn't wake up after a long time, and you almost killed me..." Her voice became smaller and smaller, and she turned her head to the side, her face flushed with a little purple, strangely good-looking.

"So who am I? Who is my brother? Who are you? When I saw her stop, I hurriedly brought up all the questions that I had endured for a long time.

"You are the second son of the king of the Cold Ice Country, the prince, the person with the highest mana in the Cold Ice Country, your name is Ice River, your brother is the king's eldest son, called the Ice Staff, his mana is second only to you, but he is very ruthless. I am the fourth princess of the Yanbing Realm, called Senyun, you once saved my life, and it was not long after you saved me, this big thing happened, it seems that it brought you bad luck, I really don't know how to compensate..." As I said that, I felt as if a few drops of water were continuously running across the back of my hand, and this time I noticed that the water was flowing from her eyes. How can there be water in the eyes? I was surprised, but I couldn't bear to ask, because I had a lot of other, more important questions to ask.

"Actually, if he wants to be king, he can tell me, anyway, I'm not interested in this, so why hurt me?"

"Hey..." she let out a long sigh, as if this matter did not concern me only, "He is ruthless, he must be a tyrant when he becomes a king in the future, you will not let him go, and your mana is far higher than his, how can he tolerate you?" ”

"Hey..." I also felt reasonable after hearing this, but I didn't know what to do, and I only let out a long sigh, but the doubts in my heart had not yet been revealed, so I could only continue to ask, "You said that my mana is much higher than him, so why did I lose to him?" ”

"At first, I couldn't figure it out, but then after I looked at your wound, I realized that he turned out to be a dark arrow wound, and your wound was hit by a weapon you made yourself, and this weapon was dedicated to the king that day."

Listening to it, I couldn't help but shudder, it turned out to be a weapon of my own making. Then I thought, since I was dedicated to the king that day, and I was finally used by my brother, presumably he stole it, and my brother would definitely be punished, would he resist and kill the king? With this in mind, I couldn't help but ask, "Will the king be in danger?" ”

"Yes, the king has already fallen for your brother's heart-devouring technique, I'm afraid it won't be long. We must find a way to subdue them so that everyone can live and work in peace. Saying that, a little happy look came to her face.

"But how do we get there? Maybe we'll be hurt by my weapons again, and my brother seems to be using me for something, won't it be worth the loss? "I didn't really want to hit her, but I had to worry about it.

"Yes, I'm afraid to go directly, it's not easy to deal with them, but you always don't do very perfect things, you like to consciously leave loopholes, and these loopholes are usually not ordinary people can crack, I believe your brother also spent a lot of brains, otherwise he can keep you?"

"I like to leave loopholes?" I was a little puzzled, and I felt that I was a little unreasonable, but the matter was urgent, and I couldn't care about so much of my own strange behavior, so I hurriedly asked, "So what can we do?" ”

"You have a habit of keeping a diary, and I think if we can enter your studio, there are a lot of problems that I believe will be solved." Well, rest, recuperate, and then it's good to go in, it's a vicious fight. Hey..." With her sigh, the person slowly moved away, and I felt a little tired, so I went to sleep.
