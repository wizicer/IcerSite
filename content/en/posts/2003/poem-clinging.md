```
You are the waves lapping the backbone of the earth, waiting for their response
You are the splash that enriches the vitality of the sea, waiting for their return
You are the sun shining on all things in the world, waiting for their happiness

Your beliefs are so firm and your goals are so pure
You move forward desperately, forgetting the goal of everything
In the end, the laurels of the loser are still left to you
The world is indeed so unfair, the plot has long been decided
For this inevitable result, why bother to hit the head and break the blood
How does your heart think, my distant boy?

Faith, the belief in the persistent pursuit of goals
I, don't want to regret it
I want to tell myself that I fought for that outcome that has already been decided
