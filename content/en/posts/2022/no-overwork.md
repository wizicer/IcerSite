In the company culture of non-overtime, many people naturally think that they can definitely adapt, but in fact, they just think that they can adapt to the "no overtime" part, and forget the essence of "no overtime": through the effort of working hours, "no overtime" occurs.

Especially when a person has adapted to the overtime culture, his life is filled with "going to work", so "going to work" is "life", "life" is "going to work", can not find the boundary between the two, no longer have the expectation of "going to work" for a better "life", so they no longer think about how to make "no overtime" happen through the effort of working hours. As a result, this person no longer adapts to the company culture of not working overtime.
