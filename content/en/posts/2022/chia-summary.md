Much of 2023 has passed, and looking back, our team has achieved some important achievements. This year, we successfully built the first wallet on the Chia chain, the first UTXO analysis and development tool on the Chia chain, and a decentralized domain name system.

Although this year's scientific research work is under great pressure and development time is limited, some interesting features, such as multisig, private key free (social recovery), voting, layer 2 chain, etc., we can only temporarily shelve and look forward to more time and energy to develop next year.

2022 is a turning point for us, and we have successfully embarked on the road of opening up to the outside world, which is undoubtedly our biggest achievement this year. Our wallet app [Pawket] is based on the world's most decentralized blockchain network - Chia Blockchain, and currently serves users in more than 35 countries and regions.

Feature updates synchronized with the official, support online/offline/observer mode, a range of customized widgets, and issuing NFTs can be simple!

At present, we have reached a cooperation agreement with the US stablecoin company Stably to integrate the stablecoin swap function provided by Stably in the near future (only available to countries permitted by regulations). The Chia name service, also from our team, will also be officially launched in the near future and seamlessly integrated with Pawket.

In the new year, we will continue to adhere to the road of independent innovation and going global, and bring more Web3 energy from China to the world
