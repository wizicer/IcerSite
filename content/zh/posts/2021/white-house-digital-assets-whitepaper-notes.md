## Stablecoin Products and Services

    - are a type of digital asset generally designed to maintain a stable value by linking its value to a national currency or other reference assets.
    - Stablecoins are used to buy or sell other cryptocurrencies, or to lend or use the stablecoin as collateral to borrow other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency.
    - Stablecoins reached almost $147 billion in market capitalization as of November 29, 2021, 
    - largest issuers: Tether, Circle, Binance, and Dai. Diem(Libra)

    - Reserve assets backing stablecoins could include fiat currencies, traditional financial assets, or other digital assets and algorithms.
    - stablecoins represent a relatively small fraction (5%) of the digital asset industry’s total value, they facilitate more than 75% of trading on all digital asset trading platforms as of October 31, 2021.
    - Furthermore, stablecoins could find parallels in traditional payment systems, banking, or other forms of financial infrastructure service.
    - Some have compared stablecoins to private currency issued by banks before the practice was curtailed with the National Bank Act of 1863, and a shift was made to a single sovereign currency.

    - money market funds (MMFs), 
    - exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 
    - or security-based swaps.



## Regulatory Concerns in Digital Assets Products and Services


- charastics
    - cryptocurrency markets have no overarching and centralized regulatory framework,
    - leaving investments in the digital assets space vulnerable to fraud, manipulation, and abuse.
    - Some cryptocurrency market exchanges and stablecoin issuers
        - have obtained state money transmitter and sale of checks licenses from multiple states, 
        - and a few cryptocurrency companies have obtained national charters
- Stablecoin-related policy concerns include issues related to
    - market integrity,
    - investor protection,
    - consumer protection,
    - financial stability,
    - monetary policy,
    - payments,
    - and illicit activity prevention.
- risk
    - potential systemic risk posed by stablecoins
    - losses or instability of stablecoins could generate instability throughout the financial system.
    - potential fraud and manipulation
    - and the need for disclosure and transparency.
        - For example, investigations by the New York State Office of the Attorney General revealed that stablecoins issued by Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer, were not fully backed at all times, raising investor-protection concerns.
- Digital assets and related service providers can present
    - money laundering,
    - terrorist financing,
    - sanctions evasion,
    - kleptocracy,
    - and other illicit finance risks
- Criminal and terrorist activity 
    - speed of the payments and transactions
    - looser anti-money laundering compliance,
    - access to jurisdictions with weak regimes allowing for money laundering,
    - and the pseudonymity provided by certain cryptocurrencies.
    - ransomware attacks
        - The lack of safeguards in parts of the market has contributed to the rise in ransomware attacks that demand payment in cryptocurrency
        - with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network noting that $590 million in suspected ransomware payments were reported by financial institutions in the first six months of 2021, compared to $416 million in 2020.
    - While the overall criminal share of cryptocurrency activity is estimated to be a small portion of the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency market, given the size of that market, the harm of the illicit funds can be impactful.
- Cryptocurrency users may also be vulnerable
    - theft
    - fraud
    - hacks.
- environmental concerns.
    - crypto mining – the process of validating certain transactions 
    - Cryptomining computers have also been criticized for their short lifespans and the amount of e-waste they generate.
