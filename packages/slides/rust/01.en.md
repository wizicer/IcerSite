# Ownership & Lifetimes

ref: [CIS 198](http://cis198-2016s.github.io/schedule/)

---

## Ownership & Borrowing

- Explicit ownership is the biggest new feature that Rust brings to the table!
- Ownership is all&sup1; checked at compile time!
- Newcomers to Rust often find themselves "fighting with the borrow checker"
   trying to get their code to compile

<!-- 
- The ownership model is the biggest thing that Rust brings to the table, its
  claim to fame.
- Ownership is something that's checked at compile time and has as little
  runtime cost as possible.
- So it's zero (or very little) runtime cost, but you pay for it with a longer
  compilation time and learning curve. Which is where the phrase "fighitng with
  the borrow checker" comes from, when you have to work around the compiler's
  restrictions to figure out how to do what you want. 
-->

## Ownership

- A variable binding _takes ownership_ of its data.
    - A piece of data can only have one owner at a time.
- When a binding goes out of scope, the bound data is released automatically.
    - For heap-allocated data, this means de-allocation.
- Data _must be guaranteed_ to outlive its references.

```rust
fn foo() {
    // Creates a Vec object.
    // Gives ownership of the Vec object to v1.
    let mut v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v1.pop();
    v1.push(4);

    // At the end of the scope, v1 goes out of scope.
    // v1 still owns the Vec object, so it can be cleaned up.
}
```

<!-- 
So here are the basics.
- When you introduce a variable binding, it takes ownership of its data. And a
  piece of data can only have one owner at a time.
- When a variable binding goes out of scope, nothing has access to the data
  anymore, so it can be released. Which means, if it's on the heap, it can be
  de-allocated.
- And data must be guaranteed to outlive its references. Or, all references are
  guaranteed to be valid. 
-->

---

## Move Semantics

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

// Ownership of the Vec object moves to v2.
let v2 = v1;

println!("{}", v1[2]); // error: use of moved value `v1`
```

- `let v2 = v1;`
    - We don't want to copy the data, since that's expensive.
    - The data cannot have multiple owners.
    - Solution: move the Vec's ownership into `v2`, and declare `v1` invalid.
- `println!("{}", v1[2]);`
    - We know that `v1` is no longer a valid variable binding, so this is an error.
- Rust can reason about this at compile time, so it throws a compiler error.


<!--
Here's another example:
- Line 1: declare a vector v1.
- Line 2: let v2 = v1. Ownership of the vector is moved from v1 to v2.
  - we don't want to move or copy the data, that's expensive and causes other
    bugs
  - we already know the data can't have multiple owners
- Line 3: try to print v1.
  - but since the vector has been moved out of v1, it is no longer a valid
    variable binding
- all of this happens at compile time.
-->

---

## Move Semantics

- Moving ownership is a compile-time semantic; it doesn't involve moving data
  during your program.
- Moves are automatic (via assignments); no need to use something like C++'s
  `std::move`.
    - However, there are functions like `std::mem::replace` in Rust to provide
      advanced ownership management.

<!-- 
- Moving ownership is an impliict operation done at compile time. No data is
  moved or copied around when your program is being run.
- The movement of data is automatic, you don't need to call anything like
  std::move (as in C++).
- But you can do more fine-grained ownership or memory movement with a number of
  standrard library functions, like std::mem::replace.
 -->

---

## Ownership

- Ownership does not always have to be moved.
- What would happen if it did? Rust would get very tedious to write:

```rust
fn vector_length(v: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    // Do whatever here,
    // then return ownership of `v` back to the caller
}
```

- You could imagine that this does not scale well either.
    - The more variables you had to hand back, the longer your return type would be!
    - Imagine having to pass ownership around for 5+ variables at a time :(

<!-- 
- Ownership doesn't have to be moved.
- If it did, you would also have to return ownership at the end of every
  function, or have all of your variables constantly going out of scope.
- This gets absurd very quickly, imagine having to return all of your function
  arguments as return values just to make sure they don't go out of scope.
 -->

---

## Borrowing

- Obviously, this is not the case.
- Instead of transferring ownership, we can _borrow_ data.
- A variable's data can be borrowed by taking a reference to the variable;
  ownership doesn't change.
    - When a reference goes out of scope, the borrow is over.
    - The original variable retains ownership throughout.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

// v_ref is a reference to v.
let v_ref = &v;

// use v_ref to access the data in the vector v.
assert_eq!(v[1], v_ref[1]);
```

<!-- 
- Obviously, this is not the case in Rust, otherwise the language would be
  impossible to use.
- Instead, we can temporarily transfer ownership by borrowing data.
- The way that borrowing works is: you can take a reference to the original
  variable and use it to access the data.
- When a reference goes out of scope, the borrow is over.
- However, the original variable retains ownership during the borrow and
  afterwards.
 -->

---

## Borrowing

- Caveat: this adds restrictions to the original variable.
- Ownership cannot be transferred from a variable while references to it exist.
    - That would invalidate the reference.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

// v_ref is a reference to v.
let v_ref = &v;

// Moving ownership to v_new would invalidate v_ref.
// error: cannot move out of `v` because it is borrowed
let v_new = v;
```

<!-- 
- This adds a caveat: ownership cannot be ransferred *from* a variable that is
  currently being borrowed, because that would invalidate the reference.
 -->

---

## Borrowing

```rust
/// `length` only needs `vector` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(vec_ref: &Vec<i32>) -> usize {
    // vec_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    vec_ref.len()
    // you can also explicitly dereference.
    // (*vec_ref).len()
}

fn main() {
    let vector = vec![];
    length(&vector);
    println!("{:?}", vector); // this is fine
}
```

- Note the type of `length`: `vec_ref` is passed by reference, so it's now an `&Vec<i32>`.
- References, like bindings, are *immutable* by default.
- The borrow is over after the reference goes out of scope (at the end of `length`).

---

## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `vector` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push(vec_ref: &mut Vec<i32>, x: i32) {
    vec_ref.push(x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut vector: Vec<i32> = vec![];
    let vector_ref: &mut Vec<i32> = &mut vector;
    push(vector_ref, 4);
}
```

- Variables can be borrowed by _mutable_ reference: `&mut vec_ref`.
    - `vec_ref` is a reference to a mutable `Vec`.
    - The type is `&mut Vec<i32>`, not `&Vec<i32>`.
- Different from a reference which is variable.

---

## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `vector` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push2(vec_ref: &mut Vec<i32>, x: i32) {
    // error: cannot move out of borrowed content.
    let vector = *vec_ref;
    vector.push(x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut vector = vec![];
    push2(&mut vector, 4);
}
```

- Error! You can't dereference `vec_ref` into a variable binding because that
  would change the ownership of the data.

---

## Borrowing

- Rust will auto-dereference variables...
    - When making method calls on a reference.
    - When passing a reference as a function argument.

```rust
/// `length` only needs `vector` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(vec_ref: &&Vec<i32>) -> usize {
    // vec_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    vec_ref.len()
}

fn main() {
    let vector = vec![];
    length(&&&&&&&&&&&&vector);
}
```

---

## Borrowing

- You will have to dereference variables...
    - When writing into them.
    - And other times that usage may be ambiguous.

```rust
let mut a = 5;
let ref_a = &mut a;
*ref_a = 4;
println!("{}", *ref_a + 4);
// ==> 8
```

---

## `ref`

```rust
let mut vector = vec![0];

{
      // These are equivalent
      let ref1 = &vector;
      let ref ref2 = vector;
      assert_eq!(ref1, ref2);
}

let ref mut ref3 = vector;
ref3.push(1);
```

- When binding a variable, `ref` can be applied to make the variable a reference to the assigned value.
    - Take a mutable reference with `ref mut`.
- This is most useful in `match` statements when destructuring patterns.

---

## `ref`

```rust
let mut vectors = (vec![0], vec![1]);
match vectors {
    (ref v1, ref mut v2) => {
        v1.len();
        v2.push(2);
    }
}
```

- Use `ref` and `ref mut` when binding variables inside match statements.

---

## `Copy` Types

- Rust defines a trait&sup1; named `Copy` that signifies that a type may be
    copied instead whenever it would be moved.
- Most primitive types are `Copy` (`i32`, `f64`, `char`, `bool`, etc.)
- Types that contain references may not be `Copy` (e.g. `Vec`, `String`).
```rust
let x: i32 = 12;
let y = x; // `i32` is `Copy`, so it's not moved :D
println!("x still works: {}, and so does y: {}", x, y);
```

## Borrowing Rules
##### _The Holy Grail of Rust_
Learn these rules, and they will serve you well.

- You can't keep borrowing something after it stops existing.
- One object may have many immutable references to it (`&T`).
- **OR** _exactly one_ mutable reference (`&mut T`) (not both).
- That's it!

---

### Borrowing Prevents...

- Iterator invalidation due to mutating a collection you're iterating over.
- This pattern can be written in C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript...
    - But may result in, e.g, `ConcurrentModificationException` (at runtime!)

```rust
let mut vs = vec![1,2,3,4];
for v in &vs {
    vs.pop();
    // ERROR: cannot borrow `vs` as mutable because
    // it is also borrowed as immutable
}
```

- `pop` needs to borrow `vs` as mutable in order to modify the data.
- But `vs` is being borrowed as immutable by the loop!

---

### Borrowing Prevents...

- Use-after-free
- Valid in C, C++...

```rust
let y: &i32;
{
    let x = 5;
    y = &x; // error: `x` does not live long enough
}
println!("{}", *y);
```

- The full error message:

```text
error: `x` does not live long enough
note: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement
    0 at 1:16
...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix
    following statement 0 at 4:18
```

- This eliminates a _huge_ number of memory safety bugs _at compile time_.

<!-- 
As a side note, this technique of creating a block to limit the scope of a
variable (in this case x) is pretty useful.
 -->

---

## Example: Vectors

- You can iterate over `Vec`s in three different ways:

```rust
let mut vs = vec![0,1,2,3,4,5,6];

// Borrow immutably
for v in &vs { // Can also write `for v in vs.iter()`
    println!("I'm borrowing {}.", v);
}

// Borrow mutably
for v in &mut vs { // Can also write `for v in vs.iter_mut()`
    *v = *v + 1;
    println!("I'm mutably borrowing {}.", v);
}

// Take ownership of the whole vector
for v in vs { // Can also write `for v in vs.into_iter()`
    println!("I now own {}! AHAHAHAHA!", v);
}

// `vs` is no longer valid
```
