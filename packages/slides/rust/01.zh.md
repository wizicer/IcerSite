## 所有权和借用

Ownership & Borrowing

- 显式所有权(Explicit ownership)是Rust带来的最大的新特性！
- 所有权全都&sup1;在编译时检查！
- Rust的新手经常发现自己在"与借用检查器战斗"，试图让他们的代码编译通过

<!-- 
- 所有权模型是Rust带来的最大的特性，它的名声就源于此。
- 所有权是在编译时检查的，并且尽可能地减少运行时的代价。
- 所以它的运行时代价几乎为零（或者非常少），但你需要付出更长的编译时间和学习曲线。
- 这就是"与借用检查器战斗"这个短语的来源，尤其是当你必须绕过编译器的限制来弄清楚如何做你想做的事情。 
-->

## 所有权

Ownership

- 一个变量绑定对其数据 _获取所有权_。
    - 一个数据在同一时间只能有一个所有者。
- 当绑定超出作用域时，绑定的数据会自动释放。
    - 对于堆分配的数据，这意味着解除分配。
- 数据 _必须保证_ 比其引用的生命周期长。

```rust
fn foo() {
    // 创建一个Vec对象。
    // 将Vec对象的所有权给予v1。
    let mut v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v1.pop();
    v1.push(4);

    // 在作用域结束时，v1超出作用域。
    // v1仍然拥有Vec对象的所有权，所以它可以被清理。
}
```

<!-- 
以下是基础知识。
- 当你引入一个变量绑定时，它获取其数据的所有权。并且一个数据在同一时间只能有一个所有者。
- 当一个变量绑定超出作用域时，没有任何东西可以访问该数据，所以它可以被释放。也就是说，如果它在堆上，它可以被解除分配。
- 并且数据必须保证比其引用的生命周期长。或者，所有引用都保证是有效的。

## Move Semantics

```rust
let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3];

// Ownership of the Vec object moves to v2.
let v2 = v1;

println!("{}", v1[2]); // error: use of moved value `v1`
```

- `let v2 = v1;`
    - We don't want to copy the data, since that's expensive.
    - The data cannot have multiple owners.
    - Solution: move the Vec's ownership into `v2`, and declare `v1` invalid.
- `println!("{}", v1[2]);`
    - We know that `v1` is no longer a valid variable binding, so this is an error.
- Rust can reason about this at compile time, so it throws a compiler error.


<!--
Here's another example:
- Line 1: declare a vector v1.
- Line 2: let v2 = v1. Ownership of the vector is moved from v1 to v2.
  - we don't want to move or copy the data, that's expensive and causes other
    bugs
  - we already know the data can't have multiple owners
- Line 3: try to print v1.
  - but since the vector has been moved out of v1, it is no longer a valid
    variable binding
- all of this happens at compile time.
-->

---

## Move Semantics

- Moving ownership is a compile-time semantic; it doesn't involve moving data
  during your program.
- Moves are automatic (via assignments); no need to use something like C++'s
  `std::move`.
    - However, there are functions like `std::mem::replace` in Rust to provide
      advanced ownership management.

<!-- 
- Moving ownership is an impliict operation done at compile time. No data is
  moved or copied around when your program is being run.
- The movement of data is automatic, you don't need to call anything like
  std::move (as in C++).
- But you can do more fine-grained ownership or memory movement with a number of
  standrard library functions, like std::mem::replace.
 -->

---

## Ownership

- Ownership does not always have to be moved.
- What would happen if it did? Rust would get very tedious to write:

```rust
fn vector_length(v: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    // Do whatever here,
    // then return ownership of `v` back to the caller
}
```

- You could imagine that this does not scale well either.
    - The more variables you had to hand back, the longer your return type would be!
    - Imagine having to pass ownership around for 5+ variables at a time :(

<!-- 
- Ownership doesn't have to be moved.
- If it did, you would also have to return ownership at the end of every
  function, or have all of your variables constantly going out of scope.
- This gets absurd very quickly, imagine having to return all of your function
  arguments as return values just to make sure they don't go out of scope.
 -->

---

## Borrowing

- Obviously, this is not the case.
- Instead of transferring ownership, we can _borrow_ data.
- A variable's data can be borrowed by taking a reference to the variable;
  ownership doesn't change.
    - When a reference goes out of scope, the borrow is over.
    - The original variable retains ownership throughout.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

// v_ref is a reference to v.
let v_ref = &v;

// use v_ref to access the data in the vector v.
assert_eq!(v[1], v_ref[1]);
```

<!-- 
- Obviously, this is not the case in Rust, otherwise the language would be
  impossible to use.
- Instead, we can temporarily transfer ownership by borrowing data.
- The way that borrowing works is: you can take a reference to the original
  variable and use it to access the data.
- When a reference goes out of scope, the borrow is over.
- However, the original variable retains ownership during the borrow and
  afterwards.
 -->

---

## Borrowing

- Caveat: this adds restrictions to the original variable.
- Ownership cannot be transferred from a variable while references to it exist.
    - That would invalidate the reference.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

// v_ref is a reference to v.
let v_ref = &v;

// Moving ownership to v_new would invalidate v_ref.
// error: cannot move out of `v` because it is borrowed
let v_new = v;
```

<!-- 
- This adds a caveat: ownership cannot be ransferred *from* a variable that is
  currently being borrowed, because that would invalidate the reference.
 -->

---

## Borrowing

```rust
/// `length` only needs `vector` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(vec_ref: &Vec<i32>) -> usize {
    // vec_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    vec_ref.len()
    // you can also explicitly dereference.
    // (*vec_ref).len()
}

fn main() {
    let vector = vec![];
    length(&vector);
    println!("{:?}", vector); // this is fine
}
```

- Note the type of `length`: `vec_ref` is passed by reference, so it's now an `&Vec<i32>`.
- References, like bindings, are *immutable* by default.
- The borrow is over after the reference goes out of scope (at the end of `length`).

---

## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `vector` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push(vec_ref: &mut Vec<i32>, x: i32) {
    vec_ref.push(x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut vector: Vec<i32> = vec![];
    let vector_ref: &mut Vec<i32> = &mut vector;
    push(vector_ref, 4);
}
```

- Variables can be borrowed by _mutable_ reference: `&mut vec_ref`.
    - `vec_ref` is a reference to a mutable `Vec`.
    - The type is `&mut Vec<i32>`, not `&Vec<i32>`.
- Different from a reference which is variable.

---

## Borrowing

```rust
/// `push` needs to modify `vector` so it is borrowed mutably.
fn push2(vec_ref: &mut Vec<i32>, x: i32) {
    // error: cannot move out of borrowed content.
    let vector = *vec_ref;
    vector.push(x);
}

fn main() {
    let mut vector = vec![];
    push2(&mut vector, 4);
}
```

- Error! You can't dereference `vec_ref` into a variable binding because that
  would change the ownership of the data.

---

## Borrowing

- Rust will auto-dereference variables...
    - When making method calls on a reference.
    - When passing a reference as a function argument.

```rust
/// `length` only needs `vector` temporarily, so it is borrowed.
fn length(vec_ref: &&Vec<i32>) -> usize {
    // vec_ref is auto-dereferenced when you call methods on it.
    vec_ref.len()
}

fn main() {
    let vector = vec![];
    length(&&&&&&&&&&&&vector);
}
```

---

## Borrowing

- You will have to dereference variables...
    - When writing into them.
    - And other times that usage may be ambiguous.

```rust
let mut a = 5;
let ref_a = &mut a;
*ref_a = 4;
println!("{}", *ref_a + 4);
// ==> 8
```

---

## `ref`

```rust
let mut vector = vec![0];

{
      // These are equivalent
      let ref1 = &vector;
      let ref ref2 = vector;
      assert_eq!(ref1, ref2);
}

let ref mut ref3 = vector;
ref3.push(1);
```

- When binding a variable, `ref` can be applied to make the variable a reference to the assigned value.
    - Take a mutable reference with `ref mut`.
- This is most useful in `match` statements when destructuring patterns.

---

## `ref`

```rust
let mut vectors = (vec![0], vec![1]);
match vectors {
    (ref v1, ref mut v2) => {
        v1.len();
        v2.push(2);
    }
}
```

- Use `ref` and `ref mut` when binding variables inside match statements.

---

## `Copy` Types

- Rust defines a trait&sup1; named `Copy` that signifies that a type may be
    copied instead whenever it would be moved.
- Most primitive types are `Copy` (`i32`, `f64`, `char`, `bool`, etc.)
- Types that contain references may not be `Copy` (e.g. `Vec`, `String`).
```rust
let x: i32 = 12;
let y = x; // `i32` is `Copy`, so it's not moved :D
println!("x still works: {}, and so does y: {}", x, y);
```

## Borrowing Rules
##### _The Holy Grail of Rust_
Learn these rules, and they will serve you well.

- You can't keep borrowing something after it stops existing.
- One object may have many immutable references to it (`&T`).
- **OR** _exactly one_ mutable reference (`&mut T`) (not both).
- That's it!

---

### Borrowing Prevents...

- Iterator invalidation due to mutating a collection you're iterating over.
- This pattern can be written in C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript...
    - But may result in, e.g, `ConcurrentModificationException` (at runtime!)

```rust
let mut vs = vec![1,2,3,4];
for v in &vs {
    vs.pop();
    // ERROR: cannot borrow `vs` as mutable because
    // it is also borrowed as immutable
}
```

- `pop` needs to borrow `vs` as mutable in order to modify the data.
- But `vs` is being borrowed as immutable by the loop!

---

### Borrowing Prevents...

- Use-after-free
- Valid in C, C++...

```rust
let y: &i32;
{
    let x = 5;
    y = &x; // error: `x` does not live long enough
}
println!("{}", *y);
```

- The full error message:

```text
error: `x` does not live long enough
note: reference must be valid for the block suffix following statement
    0 at 1:16
...but borrowed value is only valid for the block suffix
    following statement 0 at 4:18
```

- This eliminates a _huge_ number of memory safety bugs _at compile time_.

<!-- 
As a side note, this technique of creating a block to limit the scope of a
variable (in this case x) is pretty useful.
 -->

---

## Example: Vectors

- You can iterate over `Vec`s in three different ways:

```rust
let mut vs = vec![0,1,2,3,4,5,6];

// Borrow immutably
for v in &vs { // Can also write `for v in vs.iter()`
    println!("I'm borrowing {}.", v);
}

// Borrow mutably
for v in &mut vs { // Can also write `for v in vs.iter_mut()`
    *v = *v + 1;
    println!("I'm mutably borrowing {}.", v);
}

// Take ownership of the whole vector
for v in vs { // Can also write `for v in vs.into_iter()`
    println!("I now own {}! AHAHAHAHA!", v);
}

// `vs` is no longer valid
```
